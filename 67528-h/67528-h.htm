<h3>
FOREWORD.
</h3>

<p>
This is a story about the very real
people and events; if ever you chance
to read the old Sagas of Norway
you will come upon most of the characters
of this tale.  The viking age was not Christian,
it was full of the clash of arms and of
unknightly deeds, yet its story is vitally
interesting.
</p>

<p>
The Hammer of Thor, the War-god of
northern Europe, did not yield to the Cross
of Christ without a struggle, and the story
of Norway's conversion is intensely
dramatic.  King Hakon the Good, a foster-son
of the English King Athelstan, was forced
to recant his faith in order to hold his
throne; King Olaf Triggveson lost his
kingdom, or rather gave it up, at Svolde
Sound, because he refused to do the like;
and King Olaf the Thick, who followed
him, fell beneath the heathen weapons of
his subjects, becoming the patron saint of
Norway.
</p>

<p>
It was the first King Olaf who broke the
power of the old gods and who introduced
Christianity into his realm.  Short as was
his reign, he was the greatest king Norway
ever had.  He built the first church in the
land, and sent the first missionaries to
Iceland; during his reign Thangbrand, the
priest, won that island to the true faith.
</p>

<p>
Many of the incidents narrated are
taken direct from the Sagas, and although
King Olaf is said to have died at Svolde,
the story of his escape is well authenticated;
I give his own words in refusing to
win back his kingdom.  He went to Rome
and the Holy Land and held rule there
under the Crusader Kings of Jerusalem,
dying fifty years later.  King Edward the
Confessor used to have the story of his life
chanted to his court once every year, upon
his death being reported in England during
that king's reign.

NOTES.
</h3>

<p>
"<i>bonders.</i>"&mdash;This word is used in the
Sagas to represent the free farmers of
Norway, who held their lands from the
king, or owned them; they were subject
only to the orders of the king or his Jarls,
and are equivalent to our own "farmers,"
except that they had special rights and
privileges.
</p>

<p>
"<i>scat.</i>"&mdash;A fine or any other penalty
which might be imposed on an offender by
an assembly of the people.  The scat was
usually a fine of money, lands, or goods.
</p>

<p>
"<i>skoal.</i>"&mdash;This plain word corresponds
to our own "Hurrah!"  It means both long
life, good health, and joy, and is still used
in Norway in that sense.
</p>

<p>
I have avoided the use of many words
which are usually retained in the translations
of the old Sagas. Nearly all the facts
about which the story of Sigurd Fairhair is
woven are historical, and are taken from
the Heimskringla, and the Saga of King
Olaf by the Abbot Berg Sokkason.  Both
histories were compiled from the accounts
of eye-witnesses of the events contained
therein, to a great extent, and especially
was this true with the life of Olaf
Triggveson.&mdash;<i>The Author</i>.

<h3>
CHAPTER I.
<br /><br />
HOW THE VOW WAS MADE.
</h3>

<p>
The great hall of the Danish kings at
Leira was filled to overflowing on this
autumn evening of the year 994, for
King Harald Gormson had fallen in battle
some weeks before, and his son Svein
Twyskiegge, of Forkbeard, was celebrating
his accession feast in the hall of his fathers.
</p>

<p>
Around the town lay a whole city of
tents and brush huts, for besides the Danish
lords present, sixty ships had come from
Jomsborg, bearing the noblest of the famous
Viking brotherhood, under their chiefs Jarl
Sigvald and Bui the Thick.  Visitors and
Danes were clad in their bravest array, and
both town and camp presented a scene of
the gayest festivity.
</p>

<p>
Within, the hall was hung with ancient
arms and trophies of the chase, the floor
was strewn with a thick layer of fresh
rushes, and the long tables were heaped
high with dishes.  At one end of the hall
sat King Svein, with his chiefs and the
Jomsborg nobles, while above them towered
the high-seat or throne of the king; along
the hall were ranged the vikings and men
of Denmark, with Queen Gunhild and her
ladies sitting at the far end.
</p>

<p>
Servants flitted in and out, bearing food
and horns of ale, while in the center of the
hall, between the tables and before the seat
of the king, sat two skalds, singing to the
music of their harps the great deeds of
King Harald and of his son, the new king.
Presently, as the hunger of the throng was
somewhat appeased, all began to wonder
what vow the king would make, for it was
the custom that at the heirship feast the
new king should make a vow to do some
great and noble deed.
</p>

<p>
Seated near Queen Gunhild as guests of
honor were two boys, one fair and
ruddy-cheeked, the other darker and with very
quick, bold eyes.  The latter, Vagn Akison,
was a nephew of Bui, the Jomsborg chief,
and grandson of Palnatoki, the founder of
the viking brotherhood; although he was
only seventeen, he and his cousin Sigurd
were already well known for the prowess.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd Fairhair, who was a year younger
than Vagn, was in high spirits to-night, for
a little before King Svein had given him a
very fine sword, and he was proud of it.
</p>

<p>
Glancing over at him with a smile,
Queen Gunhild said, "Sigurd, have you
shown Astrid your new sword?"
</p>

<p>
"Of course he has," replied Astrid, her
niece, who sat beside Sigurd, and her dark
eyes gleamed with fun.  "He is going to
try its edge on the big pine tree near the
harbor to-morrow!"
</p>

<p>
At this sally a laugh went up, and Vagn
cried, "Be careful not to bring down the
tree into the harbor, Sigurd!  It would be
a pity to sink all our best ships!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd reddened, and retorted, "Well, I
never aroused the whole camp just because
a pig was wandering around in the bushes!"
</p>

<p>
This turned the laugh on his cousin, who
had wakened the camp the night before,
mistaking a pig for a spy, and even the
Queen joined heartily in the merriment.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly a silence fell on the tables, for
King Svein had arisen and was holding in
both hands a great silver bowl.  Amid a
dead hush he drained it, handed it to an
attendant, and stepped to the high-seat.
Grasping an arm of this, the king turned.
</p>

<p>
"Here, as I ascend the throne of my
father Harald, I vow that with the help of
God I will lead my fleet to the land of
England, and ere three winters have passed I
will chase King Ethelred from the land and
sit in his throne!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-009"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-009.jpg" alt="&quot;I will lead my fleet to the land of England.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;<i>I will lead my fleet to the land of England.</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>
As King Svein took his seat a low
murmur of astonishment ran around the hall,
followed by a tremendous shout of "Skoal!
Skoal!" for this was a great vow to be
fulfilled.
</p>

<p>
"See how pale the Queen is," whispered
Astrid to Sigurd.  "The vow must have
surprised her also."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Queen Gunhild had turned white,
for the King's vow meant that a great war
would be undertaken, and how it would end
no man could tell.  Before Sigurd could
reply, Jarl Sigvald arose and called for
silence.
</p>

<p>
"Men of Denmark and Jomsborg," he
said slowly, in his deep voice, the light
glinting on his dark, strong face and black
eyes, "I also would make a vow, and no
light one.  As you all know, Jarl Hakon,
a heathen man and doubly a traitor, rules
Norway while the rightful king, Tryggvee's
son, is a wanderer or mayhap dead.  This
then is my vow: that I go to Norway ere
three winters pass, take the rule from the
hands of Jarl Hakon, and drive him from
the land."
</p>

<p>
Sigvald sat down, amid a dead hush of
amazement; but it was broken by a shout
from young Vagn Akison.
</p>

<p>
"Skoal, Jarl Sigvald, skoal!"
</p>

<p>
Then what a cheer went up!  Ere it subsided,
Sigvald's brother, Thorkel the Tall,
leaped to his feet and swore to follow the
Jarl; Bui the Thick joined him, and amid
fresh cheers, Vagn, from the other end of
the hall, cried:
</p>

<p>
"I, too!  And ere I return I will slay
Thorkel Leira, the villain who betrayed my
father to his death!"
</p>

<p>
"Skoal!" shouted Sigurd, excitedly,
"I'm with you, Vagn!"
</p>

<p>
As the tumult subsided, the Queen looked
at Vagn and Sigurd sadly.  "You are rash
boys, you two!  Do you realize what blood
and tears these oaths will cost?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd answered her respectfully.
"Noble Gunhild, that may well be; yet Jarl
Hakon is an evil man and a pagan, as is
Thorkel.  At any rate, I won't have to try
my new sword on the tree, now!"  His
keen gray eyes twinkled.
</p>

<p>
The Queen made no reply, however, and
sat watching King Svein; but Astrid
whispered:
</p>

<p>
"I think that was splendid!  I wish I
could go, too!"
</p>

<p>
Vagn laughed.  "You'd be a fine one!
Why, the first war-horn would send you
down below trembling!"
</p>

<p>
"It wouldn't either!" retorted the girl
indignantly.  "I can shoot better than you
or Sigurd, either of you!"
</p>

<p>
"Good!  I challenge you to a match
to-morrow," cried Sigurd.  "We'll go over to
the shore beyond the harbor, where no one
will interrupt, and if you best either of us
I'll give you my trained falcon from
France!"
</p>

<p>
"Then look out," laughed Astrid, "because
I'm going to win the bird to-morrow
morning!"
</p>

<p>
With this she arose and followed the
Queen, who was leaving.  The two boys,
not wishing to join in the carouse that most
of the vikings would keep up for the better
part of the night, also left the hall and
proceeded to their own tent.
</p>

<p>
"What think you of these vows,
Sigurd?" asked Vagn, as they went along.
</p>

<p>
"Well, now that we have cooled down,
it looks rather different," replied Sigurd,
thoughtfully.  "It is one thing for King
Svein to conquer England, with the
resources of a realm at his command, and
another for Sigvald to conquer Norway with
only the brother of Jomsborg behind him."
</p>

<p>
"But remember, Fairhair, we are Christians,
while Hakon is a pagan and a traitor;
that will make some difference, surely!
My own vow was no hasty thing; I must
avenge my father's death or else be
disgraced forever."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded thoughtfully, for he well
knew that the fierce vikings would yield
small obedience to a man who appeared
unable to avenge the betrayal of his father.
As they turned in at their tent, a man
ran up, and Vagn recognized one of Bui's
men in the moonlight.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, Egil, what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"You and Sigurd are wanted at council
in Jarl Sigvald's big tent," panted the man.
</p>

<p>
Without delay, the boys followed him to
the large tent of the Jarl.  Here they found
all the Jomsborg leaders assembled, and
took their places beside Bui of Bornholm,
who was speaking as they entered.
</p>

<p>
"It was a rash vow, Sigvald, but we
cannot back out, and it may well be that
we shall win great honor in the effort, win
or lose.  Our vikings are the best warriors
in the world to-day, and we will at least
give a hard battle to Hakon and his son
Eirik."
</p>

<p>
A murmur of assent ran around the
tent, and Sigvald arose.
</p>

<p>
"Brothers, I was over-hasty in the vow,
but it cannot be helped.  This is my
counsel; that since the attempt must be made,
we make it without delay, send for the rest
of our men, and strike at Norway's capital
without delay.  What think you?"
</p>

<p>
Vagn stepped forward.  "I will answer
for my father's ships and men.  Let us
strike before Hakon can meet us; we have
the pick of our men here, with most of
our ships.  We can leave here at the end of
the week, wait at Limafiord for the rest of
our men, then sweep up to Thrandheim."
</p>

<p>
"Good for you, Vagn!" cried his uncle.
"Men say that I am somewhat stout, but
my friends never complain of my weight in
battle!"  Everyone laughed, for although
Bui deserved his nickname, he was one of
the greatest warriors of the day.  "I'll let
Sigurd here go with you, if you want him,"
he continued, and the boy's heart leaped
with joy, for this was indeed just what he
did want.
</p>

<p>
Jarl Sigvald smiled.  "Then is it agreed
that we go from here to Limafiord on the
fourth day?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes!"  The answer was accompanied
by a clash of weapons, as the chiefs struck
sword and spear on shield, and the council
was over, although most of the leaders
remained to talk over details and despatch
a messenger to Jomsborg at once.
</p>

<p>
The boys returned to their tent, however,
and as they dropped off to sleep the shouts
of "Skoal!  Skoal!" drifted faintly to them
from the town, and they knew that the
vikings and the Danes were still making
vows, some of which they would bitterly
repent in the morning.

<h3>
CHAPTER II.
<br /><br />
THE SHOOTING-MATCH.
</h3>

<p>
Early next morning the boys were
afoot, and after a hasty breakfast
beside a camp fire they took their bows
and quivers and started for town.
</p>

<p>
Astrid lived with Queen Gunhild at the
Kings' Hall, and thither they directed their
steps.  Early as it was, the place was
thronged with servants, who were laying
fresh rushes in the hall and putting the
place in order for the day.  Seeing a house-carl
pass, with his clipped hair and golden
collar, Sigurd called him and sent him to
ask if the Lady Astrid was ready.
</p>

<p>
Five minutes later Astrid herself
appeared, bearing bow and quiver, and joined
them with a cheery, "Good-morning, my
vikings!  Has your rash resolution cooled
off yet?"
</p>

<p>
"Small chance of that," replied Vagn,
his half-grave, half-humorous eyes lighting
up in a quick smile.
</p>

<p>
"My falcon is ready to change owners,"
added Sigurd, "but then there is no chance
for that to-day, of course."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, indeed!"  Astrid's dark eyes
flashed gayly.  "That remains to be seen,
my lord of Jomsborg and Bornholm!"
</p>

<p>
Talking and laughing, they started off,
leaving the town behind and cutting across
the fields to the harbor.  There, as they
came to the brow of the hill, they paused.
Far below lay the great fleet, the sixty
Jomsborg ships and those of the assembled
Danish lords, their shield-rims glittering in
the morning sun, their dragon-prows and
high carved sterns gilded or painted in
bright array.
</p>

<p>
Astrid caught her breath in admiration.
"Oh, how wonderful it is to be a viking!
I wish I were a boy!"
</p>

<p>
The other two laughed.  "It is not so
very wonderful," smiled Sigurd.  "I think
it is hard work.  Every morning the drilling
and practice in arms, the weapons to be
rubbed up&mdash;and the rowing!  Whew, my
back hurts even to think of those low,
heavy oars!"
</p>

<p>
"There's our ship, with the gilded
prow," pointed Vagn, to a large long-ship
apart from the rest.  "Sigurd talks a lot
about work, but he is equal to any man in
the fleet with sword and shield, save his
father, or the Jarl&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Or yourself," broke in his cousin quickly.
"However, let's get on; I'm anxious to
decide the fate of my falcon."
</p>

<p>
They left the road, and after walking
two or three miles, came out on a lonely
stretch of shore, wild and rocky.  Vagn had
brought an old wooden shield with him, and
he set this up as target on a large rock a
hundred feet distant.
</p>

<p>
"Do you shoot first," ordered Astrid.
"I'll go next, then Vagn."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded, and selected an arrow.
Stringing his bow, he laid the shaft and
pulled the string to his ear.  Twang!  The
arrow was buried deep in the shield, just
above the center boss of iron.
</p>

<p>
"Good enough!" cried Vagn, running
forward, but Astrid only smiled and raised
her bow.  The string twanged, and an
answering echo came back as the arrow
glanced off and the shield fell backward.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" cried Vagn, picking it up.
"Full on the iron boss!  But you can't do
it again!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd ran forward to see also, and as
they examined the shield, a sudden cry
startled them.  Turning, they saw Astrid
struggling with three men, while more
appeared coming from behind a corner of
the cliff.
</p>

<p>
"Norsemen and spies!" exclaimed
Sigurd, and without an instant's hesitation
he picked up Astrid's arrow and ran
forward, fitting it to his bow.
</p>

<p>
"Your sword!" called Vagn, tearing the
peace-bands from his own weapon as he
ran.  A shout answered him, and the
Norseman ran forward to meet Sigurd.  A
spear whizzed by his head, and he loosed
the bow.
</p>

<p>
The foremast viking fell with a clash,
and as the others paused Sigurd tore the
peace-bands from his sword.  Next
instant he was surrounded, struggling,
striking, and he realized that more and
more men had appeared from behind the
cliff.
</p>

<p>
Now a blade gleamed beside him, and
Vagn's voice sounded in his ear.  One man
was down&mdash;two; but others filled their
places, and a heavy axe was poised over
Sigurd.  As it fell the boy darted in
beneath the blow, and his sword fell on the
viking's shoulder; but at that instant
something crashed on his light steel cap, and he
knew no more.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd awoke with a dull pain in his
head, to find his arms tightly bound and the
midday sun beating down on him.  Raising
his head, Fairhair saw that he lay on
the forecastle of a small ship, with Vagn
beside him, wounded in the shoulder and
unconscious.
</p>

<p>
He saw nothing of Astrid, and a burning
thirst consumed him; with a great effort he
rose to a sitting position and looked
around.  They were out at sea, and the land
lay far behind them; in the stern and waist
of the ship were fifteen or twenty Norsemen.
</p>

<p>
"That was a stiff crack I gave you, lad,
but the steel cap saved your skull," sounded
a voice, and Sigurd twisted around.  Behind
him stood a dark man with an unpleasant
face and straw-colored hair; evidently
he was the leader, for he had just come out
of the cabin.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd tried to speak, but his tongue was
dry, and the man laughed.  "Here, Thord,"
he called, "bring a horn of water."
</p>

<p>
One of the men in the waist took a horn
and filled it from the cask beside the mast,
handing it up to the leader, who put it to
the boy's lips.  Sigurd drank greedily, and
then the other threw a few drops over
Vagn, who opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
He struggled to rise, with a sharp cry.
</p>

<p>
"Thorkel Leira!  I&mdash;"  The effort was
too much for him, and he fell back again.
Their captor smiled sneeringly.
</p>

<p>
"He is in a bad way to fulfill his vow,
eh?"  This was the man whom Vagn had
sworn to kill, the betrayer of his father!
As he realized this, Sigurd's head cleared.
</p>

<p>
"Why have you attacked us?  Who are
you?" he asked indignantly.
</p>

<p>
Thorkel laughed again.  "Vagn, there,
seemed to know my face!  You two and the
girl, whom I take to be Gunhild's niece,
will make a nice gift to Jarl Hakon!  Great
boasts, great boasts!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd flushed.  As he looked at the
viking, his heart gave a sudden leap, for,
framed in the cabin doorway behind, he
saw the face of Astrid, her finger on her
lips.  Making no sign, he answered the
leader calmly.
</p>

<p>
"In that case, leave us alone till we get
to Thrandheim."  As he said this, Sigurd
lay down again, turning his back on
Thorkel.  The latter sneered, and stepped to
the edge of the forecastle, above the ship's
waist.  Sigurd opened his eyes, and saw
Astrid making signs, and holding in her
hand his sword.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd comprehended the plan instantly.
He silently drew his feet up and gathered
his muscles; Thorkel was giving orders, a
few paces away, and paid no heed to him.
The boy slowly rose to one knee; he saw
Astrid run toward him, and at the same
instant he threw himself headfirst at Thorkel,
striking him fairly in the waist.
</p>

<p>
The viking fell forward with a cry, and
lay motionless on the deck beneath.  Sigurd
would have followed him over the low rail,
but for a hand that gripped his bound arms
and stayed him; then he felt the bonds cut
and a sword pushed into his hand.
</p>

<p>
"Hold the ladder," panted the girl,
"while I arouse Vagn."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd sprang to the top of the narrow
ladder that led up from the deck below just
as the surprised men seized their weapons.
An arrow tore through his hair; another
followed, but Sigurd parried it with his
blade, and another after it.  This was an
old viking exercise, and the boy felt no
fear; but with a cry of dismay Astrid ran
to the cabin, quickly returning with a
shield.
</p>

<p>
"Here, this will help you!"  Sigurd
grasped it just in time to ward off a spear,
and now the first man was on the ladder.
He held a shield above his head, but
Sigurd swung his sword and brought it
down with all his might.  The keen weapon
sheared through the tough bull's hide, and
the man fell back among his comrades.
</p>

<p>
Thord, who had brought the water, now
made a dash, coming up the ladder three
steps at a time, and wielding an axe.  As
he reached the top Sigurd drove his sword,
but too late; the axe descended on his
shield and bore him to his knees.  Again
the weapon whirled above him, and Thord
staggered backward with a hoarse cry,
clearing the ladder in his fall.
</p>

<p>
Springing up, Sigurd saw Astrid behind
him, bow in hand, and Vagn, pale but
determined, stepped to his side.  Those
below drew back, and the boys saw them
reviving Thorkel, who was stunned by his
fall.  Sigurd leaned on his sword.
</p>

<p>
"Look here, Vagn, we can't keep this
up all day; one or two good showers of
arrows will finish us."
</p>

<p>
Vagn pointed to the cabin.  "We can
hold that against them all, and Astrid says
that food and water are inside."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd laughed.  "You look like a Valkyrie,
Astrid!  I owe you thanks for my
life, too&mdash;but what is Thorkel up to?"
</p>

<p>
"Back&mdash;back to the cabin!" cried
Astrid.  "They are climbing around the
bow to take us from behind!"
</p>

<p>
A glance showed them half a dozen men
climbing through the bow under the dragon's
head up to the forecastle.  It was useless
to try to hold the whole fore-deck, so
the two boys and Astrid ran to the cabin,
shut the heavy door, and bolted it securely.
There was no window, and only one or
two high loop-holes gave fresh air to those
within.
</p>

<p>
"What chance have we of rescue?"
asked Astrid, sitting down on a pile of
furs.
</p>

<p>
"Little enough," replied Vagn, moodily,
while Sigurd threw himself down beside
her.  "No one knows where we went, and
we won't be missed till noon.  It must be
about three hours past that now."
</p>

<p>
The Norsemen, realizing the futility of
trying to break in, made no sign; and the
afternoon slowly wore away.  The ship
was bearing north under full sail, and all
three captives realized that it was only a
matter of time before they would have to
give up.
</p>

<p>
Evidently the Norsemen had been spying
on the Danes.  Vagn had been struck
down by a glancing blow, and all three
had been taken to the ship, which left the
land at once.  Astrid had been left
unbound, and had taken advantage of the
opportunity as soon as Sigurd became conscious.
</p>

<p>
Toward evening a rap sounded on the
door, and the voice of Thorkel called to
them:
</p>

<p>
"Vagn Akison!  Can you hear me?"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap03"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER III.
<br /><br />
JARL HAKON OF NORWAY.
</h3>

<p>
"Well enough," replied Vagn,
"what is it?"
</p>

<p>
"I suppose you see that you
cannot hold out for ever; but it would be
needless trouble for my men to batter in
the door.  To-morrow we will meet Jarl
Hakon, and if you give yourselves up in
peace I will not bind you."
</p>

<p>
"What shall we do?" whispered Vagn.
"It is true that we cannot hold out here."
</p>

<p>
"Do!" exclaimed Astrid.  "Would you
trust your father's betrayer?  Wait till we
meet Hakon, that will be time enough to
give up!"
</p>

<p>
Vagn raised his voice.  "We wish
nought to do with traitors, Thorkel.  Let
Jarl Hakon speak with us; till then we will
bide."
</p>

<p>
Thorkel made no answer, and they heard
him move away.  The three captives ate
some of the food, drank a little stale water,
and with nightfall the boys took watch and
watch, leaving the single couch to Astrid.
</p>

<p>
Toward morning, however, the latter
awoke and insisted on doing her share of
the watching; so Sigurd, dead tired, yielded
up his watch and dropped off to sleep.  The
boys were now suffering from their
wounds, but they had refused to let Astrid
bind them up, as this was strictly against
the laws of the Jomsvikings.
</p>

<p>
These fierce men were trained with the
greatest strictness, indeed, and death was
the penalty for the slightest infraction of
their laws.  Wounds might not be bound
up, and no pain might be complained of;
for suffering was only part of the long
training that made the Jomsborg brotherhood
the most terrible fighters in the world.
</p>

<p>
Both boys were wakened by a jar that
shook the ship, and they found the sun
well up.  "What was that shock?" they
cried, in alarm.
</p>

<p>
"Another ship," replied Astrid.  "I can
see nothing, but I heard the sound of oars
and voices."
</p>

<p>
Springing to the loopholes, they found
that they could see nothing; but the sound
of excited talking came to them, and in a
few moments steps advanced quickly to
the door.
</p>

<p>
"Ho, Vagn Akison!  Astrid of Vendland!  Open!"
</p>

<p>
Astrid seized Vagn's arm.  "It is Jarl
Hakon!  I know his voice well!"
</p>

<p>
Without hesitation, Sigurd, sheathing
his sword, threw open the door.  There in
the sunlight stood a man of lofty stature,
magnificently armed and with beard and
hair as sunny as that of Sigurd; but his
face was gloomy, and his eyes quick and
shifty.
</p>

<p>
"Do you yield to me?" he asked quietly.
</p>

<p>
Astrid laughed.  "So you war against
girls, Jarl?  Well, I suppose I must
surrender!"
</p>

<p>
The Jarl smiled, and laid his hand on
her hair.  "Keep the bow, child; you have
done nobly and well.  Come to my own
ship."
</p>

<p>
As they followed him down the ladder
and over the side, Sigurd saw that Hakon's
hair was streaked with gray, and that he
walked stiffly as from old wounds.  Beside
Thorkel's ship lay another, a splendid
warship, and as they climbed over the
bulwarks the two ships were cast apart.
Hakon led the way to his cabin, and said,
kindly:
</p>

<p>
"Sit you down and fear not.  Thorkel
has told me the tale of the vows, especially
that of yours, Vagn Akison.  By the
hammer of Thor, your comrades will have
tough work if they think to take Norway
from me!"  He smiled grimly.
</p>

<p>
"Jarl," exclaimed Astrid, "was it by
your orders that we have been attacked?
Remember that Svein is my uncle!"
</p>

<p>
Hakon nodded.  "I am sorry, indeed,
that you were taken; you will be returned
unharmed later, with whatever scat Svein
thinks just.  But who are you, Fairhair?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd laughed.  "That is truly what
men call me, Jarl; my name is Sigurd
Buisson."
</p>

<p>
Hakon whistled in surprise.  "So!  Then
I have two good hostages!  All the better;
I will take you up to Thrandheim with me,
but have no fear, for you will be well
treated&mdash;at least for the present."
</p>

<p>
With this Hakon left the cabin, giving it
up to them, and the voyage began.  The
boys were indeed treated well, their
weapons were left them, and had it not been
for the surrounding circumstances they
would have enjoyed themselves immensely.
</p>

<p>
That night they made the southern end
of Norway, for the ship was pushed on
with all speed, both of sail and oars.  Jarl
Hakon was racing for his kingdom now,
and no effort was spared to reach Thrandheim,
Norway's capital, as soon as might be.
</p>

<p>
Next morning they landed at Howes,
and Hakon sent speedy messengers north
over the mountains to his son Jarl Eirik,
who was in Raumarike; and splitting up
war arrows, dispatched them to all the
chiefs near by as a token to gather men at
once.  Then, with fresh rowers, the ship
hastened on as never ship had hastened
before, for the realm of Norway was at stake.
</p>

<p>
The following evening they stopped
at Raumsdale to send out the war-arrow
and get new rowers; but they pushed on
quickly, and on the third day sped up the
Thrandheim Firth and reached the city just
after sunset.
</p>

<p>
An immense crowd greeted them, for
the news had sped fast, and they landed amid
a great shouting and clash of arms.  Jarl
Hakon kept the boys with him, and sent
Astrid to the King's Hall, where she
would be given waiting-women and cared
for as became her rank.  Then, without
going thither himself, he turned aside,
followed by all the multitude, and
proceeded to the great temple of Thor, the
War-god.
</p>

<p>
Jarl Hakon was a pagan, believing firmly
in the old gods of Norway, as indeed
most of his subjects did.  The Thrandheim
temple was the greatest in the land, and
Jarl Hakon, as ruler of the country, was
the high-priest.
</p>

<p>
As they passed beneath the great stone
doorway Sigurd Fairhair shivered, and
Vagn whispered to him, "Firm, Sigurd,
hold firm!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd pressed his hand in reply.  As
they saw whither they were going, the
boys had resolved not to take part in the
worship of the heathen gods, for both were
Christians.  The temple was high and
gloomy, and the torches lit it very poorly;
but around the sides they could see statues
of Odin the one-eyed, Freya the beautiful,
and the other gods.  At the end, opposite
the doorway, stood a high altar before the
golden statue of Thor, and Hakon slowly
ascended the steps.
</p>

<p>
As he did so, the vikings, bonders, and
townfolk fell on their knees, and beyond
the altar Sigurd noticed the priests bringing
in a white bull for sacrifice.  Looking
around, he saw that he and Vagn were the
only ones standing; others saw it, too, and
an angry mutter ran through the vast
building, like the low gathering of a storm.
</p>

<p>
The two boys paled, but stood firm and
erect, as Jarl Hakon uttered a short prayer
to the war god.  When his voice ceased,
the mutter behind him swelled into a roar,
with fierce shouts of "Kneel!" "Kneel!"
"Death to the Christians!"
</p>

<p>
Hakon turned and raised his hand, the
roar dying away at once.  When he saw
the cause of the tumult his face darkened.
</p>

<p>
"To your knees, to your knees!  Would
you insult Thor in his own temple?"
</p>

<p>
"We kneel to none save the white
Christ," spoke out Sigurd boldly, though
his heart beat fast.
</p>

<p>
Hakon's hand flew to his sword, and the
crowd surged forward; then the Jarl's hand
dropped, and he motioned to one of his
men.
</p>

<p>
"Harald, take these two to the King's
Hall and see that no harm comes to them,
on your life.  Go!"
</p>

<p>
Without a word the boys followed the
man as he led the way out, their heads
high and their hands on their swords.
The Norsemen made way for them with
muttered threats, but gaining the open air,
their guide led them through the dark
streets, and in a few minutes stopped at
the Hall.
</p>

<p>
They were led to a room, and the door
was bolted.  At the rasp of the bolt Vagn
broke silence.
</p>

<p>
"Whew!  That was a close shave for
us, old man!  I was scared stiff when you
answered Hakon!"
</p>

<p>
"So was I," admitted Sigurd, smiling.
"But we are too valuable as hostages, so
it didn't take much bravery.  See here,
are we going to stay with Hakon?"
</p>

<p>
"Not if we can help it," laughed Vagn.
"I suppose we'll be watched closely,
though, and then we must look out for
Astrid."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded.  "Well, we'll see her in
the morning.  She is not in danger for
the present, anyway."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd was mistaken, however, for they
did not see Astrid for a week.  They were
closely confined to their room, and only on
the sixth day following were they allowed
to leave it.  Their warder was the same
who had led them from the temple the first
night.  As he came in on the sixth morning,
he left the door open, and said:
</p>

<p>
"You are free of the town, but do not
leave it.  Jarl Hakon has gone, so you had
best be watchful, as I am responsible for
you."
</p>

<p>
"Where has Hakon gone?  Is the Lady
Astrid here?" asked Vagn.
</p>

<p>
"I know nothing of any Lady Astrid,
but Jarl Hakon has gone south to More
to raise men, and will return to meet Jarl
Eirik, mayhap."
</p>

<p>
The two boys did not wait to learn more,
but hastened out to the great hall, and
there they found a woman who directed
them to Astrid's room.  Making their way
thither, Astrid came to the door with a
cry of joy.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I thought you were dead!  I saw
Jarl Hakon once, but he was terribly busy
and would tell me nothing.  Where have
you been?"
</p>

<p>
Vagn outlined their adventure at the
temple, and told of their subsequent
imprisonment in a few words.
</p>

<p>
"I never would have dared do that!"
exclaimed Astrid as he finished.  "To
brave all those men that way!  But come
over here to this window and speak low;
there are women in the next room."
</p>

<p>
Making sure that the door was fast,
Sigurd and Vagn joined her at the window.
</p>

<p>
"Last night I heard two men talking out
in the hall, and I listened.  Jarl Eirik has
gathered a great force of men from Raumadale
and Halogaland and Thrandheim, and
is fitting out an immense fleet in the
greatest haste.  Hakon is raising men in North
and South More.  Two nights ago, just
before Hakon left, a messenger came from
Eirik.
</p>

<p>
"Here is their plan.  When Hakon has
raised all the men he can, he will come
north to meet Eirik, who is making his
way south.  They expect to have at least
150 longships when they combine forces,
and intend to wait for your fleet in
Hiorunga Bay and take them in a trap."
</p>

<p>
"A trap!" cried Sigurd.  "With that
great force?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, because they are afraid of the
men of Jomsborg, even with the numbers
three to one.  The peasants are to tell Jarl
Sigvald that Hakon is in Hiorunga Bay
with only one or two ships, and Sigvald
and Bui will hurry in to capture him, thus
falling among the whole fleet.  Do you see?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd's eyes flashed.  "So Hakon is a
traitor still!  This is terrible, Vagn; in a
trap like that no one will escape!"
</p>

<p>
"I am afraid not, Fairhair," Vagn
shook his head sadly.  "Sigvald will fall
into it, for he is impetuous and hasty, as is
your father also.  I see only one thing to do."
</p>

<p>
"What is that?" cried the others, as he
paused.
</p>

<p>
"That is for you, Sigurd, and me to
steal a boat here in the harbor and sail
out south.  We have a bare chance of
reaching Sigvald in time.  Has Eirik
reached Thrandheim yet?"  He turned to Astrid.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet, but he is expected at any time."
</p>

<p>
"Then we may make it!" broke in
Sigurd, excitedly.
</p>

<p>
Here Astrid drew herself up, and said,
in a determined voice, "Wait a minute!  If
you go I go, too; you needn't think you can
leave me behind!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IV.
<br /><br />
THE RESCUE IN THE BAY.
</h3>

<p>
"That you sha'n't," replied Vagn.
"We may be blown out to sea
or captured by Eirik or Hakon;
there is no telling.  You are safe here."
</p>

<p>
Astrid's eyes flashed, and she cried,
angrily, "I say I will go!  If we are
taken, I will be just as safe; and you two
can handle a small boat in any sea."
</p>

<p>
"But, Astrid," objected Sigurd, in dismay,
"at best it will take us three days,
and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"So much the more need of another
person.  Now say no more."  She set her
mouth determinedly, and Vagn's opposition
vanished in a peal of laughter.
</p>

<p>
"Come on," he cried gayly; "I would
rather fight a dozen Norsemen than try to
oppose you!  We'll go down to the harbor
now and see about a boat."
</p>

<p>
"You seem to think it is no more than a
matter of picking out a boat and raising the
sail," laughed Sigurd, as they left the hall.
</p>

<p>
"No," returned Vagn, "but there's no
use thinking about obstacles before they
appear."
</p>

<p>
The streets were thronged with men
from the countryside roundabout, and the
armorers seemed to be doing a thriving
business.  No one paid any attention to the
three, and they soon made their way to the
waterside.
</p>

<p>
As they walked slowly along, looking at
the ships in the harbor, Sigurd suddenly
stopped.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  I believe that I have a better
plan still!" he cried.  "Do you see that
ship over there with the yellow eyes
painted in her prow?"
</p>

<p>
"What of her?" asked Vagn.
</p>

<p>
"Don't you remember?  She was in
Jomsborg a month since, and her captain is
an old friend of Jarl Sigvald's.  Why can't
we get him to take us down below
Hiorunga Bay to meet the fleet?"
</p>

<p>
"The very thing!"  Astrid clapped her
hands in delight.  "I confess that it seemed
well-nigh hopeless to make our way in a
small boat without being captured or
blown far out to sea.  But suppose he
won't take us?"
</p>

<p>
"He will," returned Vagn, "I remember
his name&mdash;Ulf Ringsson, and he will be
glad to help Sigvald.  How shall we see
him?"
</p>

<p>
"Do you take Astrid back to the hall,
and I will row out in a small boat," replied
Sigurd.  "If any are watching us, we will
throw them off that way."
</p>

<p>
So Astrid and Vagn turned back, and
Sigurd sauntered about for a time, as if
watching the shipping.  Presently he
wandered down to a boatman.
</p>

<p>
"Lend me your boat for an hour or two,
my friend," he said, handing the man a
coin.
</p>

<p>
"Willingly," responded the man, pushing
out his craft and putting the oars into
it.  "Business is not so good these days;
I fear that I may have to go with Jarl
Eirik if I want to make money!"
</p>

<p>
"Better not," laughed Sigurd, "you
might meet Jomsborg steel, and that would
be bad luck."
</p>

<p>
The man chuckled as he shoved Sigurd
off.  "No danger, my lord!  If I'm not
here when you return, just pull the boat
up and leave her."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded, and pulled slowly from
the shore.  He did not head straight out
to the ship, but visited other craft first,
asking questions of their crews and appearing
simply curious.  After a little he
reached the side of Ulf's ship, and slipping
under the side opposite the shore, clambered
over the rail.
</p>

<p>
As he set foot on the deck, a tall man
rose and faced him.  "Who are you and
what do you want?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd smiled and took off his fur cap.
"I want Ulf Ringsson, and I am Sigurd
Buisson of Bornholm."
</p>

<p>
Ulf grasped his hand with a cry of
surprise, and led him to the cabin.
</p>

<p>
"The crew is ashore, but it is best to
take no chances.  Now what are you doing
here?  I heard you had been taken by
Hakon."
</p>

<p>
The boy swiftly outlined his adventures,
told of the trap that was to be laid for
the Jomsborg fleet, and asked Ulf to help
them.
</p>

<p>
"Of course, Sigurd, of course!  I can
stow you two and the Lady Astrid away
comfortably, but if we are overhauled&mdash;well,
my men are no fighters, you know!"
</p>

<p>
"We'll take our chance of that," replied
Sigurd, thanking him warmly for his aid.
"Now, when can you sail?  Every minute
counts."
</p>

<p>
"I know, but I can't possibly start sooner
than the morning of the third day from
now.  Say midnight of the second night
after this.  My cargo is not all in, and it
would look too suspicious altogether.  But
the 'Otter' is a fast ship, and we will get
down the coast much faster than will Eirik
with his warships."
</p>

<p>
"You can expect us then," said Sigurd.
"Will you meet us on shore?"
</p>

<p>
"It will be better so," replied Ulf.  "I
will get the 'Otter' farther out before
nightfall, and will wait for you opposite
here with a small boat."
</p>

<p>
With a parting handshake Sigurd slipped
over the side again, and rowed slowly
through the shipping on his way back.  As
he passed a large ship, he saw that the
sailors were making a clumsy effort to
raise the sail.  Indeed, from their looks he
took them for newly raised levies from the
country on their way to join Hakon, as
the ship was a war vessel.  He rested a
moment, watching them with a smile; then
it died away as he saw an officer, whose
back was turned toward him, standing
directly beneath the heavy spar that the
men were hoisting.
</p>

<p>
"He'd better look out," thought Sigurd,
"if those fellows lost their grip on the
rope&mdash;ah, I thought so!"
</p>

<p>
For, even as the thought flashed through
his mind, the rope had slipped loose from
the men, and the yard fell, striking the
officer a glancing blow and knocking him
overboard.
</p>

<p>
With a shout Sigurd drove his oars into
the water and reached the place where the
man had gone down before the confused
men on the ship could put out a boat.  He
could see nothing of the man, so, quickly
throwing off his fur cap and cloak and
unbuckling his sword-belt, Sigurd took a long
breath and dived from the boat's side.
</p>

<p>
For an instant the ice-cold water paralyzed
him; then, opening his eyes, the boy
struck down.  There, just beneath him, was
the senseless face of&mdash;Thorkel Leira!
</p>

<p>
Sigurd checked his stroke.  Why not
leave this traitor and villain to his fate, so
richly deserved?  Why risk his own life
for that of a worthless fellow such as
Thorkel?  But he only hesitated an instant;
hastily gripping the man's hair, he made
for the surface.
</p>

<p>
Although Sigurd was a good swimmer,
he reached the air with a great sigh of
relief, for he had been under water nearly a
minute, and the water was too cold for
comfort.  Thorkel had been struck
senseless and made no resistance.
</p>

<p>
As he emerged, a shout sounded in his
ear, and there beside him was a small
boat.  His own skiff was not far, and after
the men at his side hauled up Thorkel, he
struck out for his own boat.  Sigurd
realized only too well that he did not want
to be questioned, for any mishap now would
ruin their plans of escape; so, paying no
heed to the shouts of the Norsemen, he
clambered over the stern of his craft,
donned his fur coat hastily, and made for
the shore.
</p>

<p>
He pulled up the boat and made off at
once.  His dripping clothes had already
frozen, and the cloak hid most of them,
so that he regained the hall without
question.  As he entered his room, Vagn
greeted him with a cry of amazement when
he threw off the cloak.
</p>

<p>
"What on earth&mdash;" he began, but Sigurd
interrupted with a laugh.
</p>

<p>
"Water, rather, Vagn.  Help me get
these wet things off first."
</p>

<p>
Jarl Hakon had sent them a goodly
supply of garments, and when Sigurd had
changed to dry clothes he recounted the
adventure to his cousin.
</p>

<p>
"Good for you, old man!" cried Vagn,
as he finished.  "I don't think that I would
have resisted the temptation to let him
drown and get rid of the wretch.  Did any
recognize you?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd shook his head.  "I got away
too quickly, and Thorkel was senseless.
The yard struck him on the shoulder, so I
suppose he wasn't very badly hurt.  Don't
say anything to Astrid about it."
</p>

<p>
"Why not?" asked Vagn, in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Well," Sigurd hesitated, "she would
make a fuss about it, and&mdash;well, I really
wish you wouldn't, old fellow!"
</p>

<p>
Seeing that Sigurd really wished it so,
Vagn agreed, and they went to Astrid's
room to tell her of their plans with Ulf.
</p>

<p>
Astrid greeted them with a laugh.  "You
changed pretty quickly, Sigurd," she said.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what do you mean?"  Both
boys stared at her.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, one of my maids just ran in and
told me how some yellow-haired stranger
rescued our old friend Thorkel down in
the harbor, and ran off before they could
find out who he was.  So I knew that it
must be Fairhair, here!"
</p>

<p>
"So it was, Astrid!" cried out Vagn.
"If I'd been there I would have let the
scoundrel drown!"
</p>

<p>
"No you wouldn't, Vagn," protested
Sigurd.  "You might kill him in fair
fight, but you wouldn't let him drown
without trying to save him!"
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," declared Astrid, looking
at Sigurd, "it was a noble thing to do,
Fairhair, and I am proud of you for it."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd blushed rosily, and hastily
turned the conversation by describing his
meeting with Ulf.
</p>

<p>
"By the way," added Vagn, "I found
out something.  At night our doors are
locked and a man sleeps outside in the
hall, before them.  Hakon must think we
are worth keeping!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd thought it over.  "The only way
I can see is to entice our guard inside and
tie him up, then go to Astrid's room and
seize her guard before he can cry out.
Any way, Astrid, be ready on the second
night from this, about midnight, and we
will get you somehow."
</p>

<p>
"We had best not be seen together in
the meantime," cautioned the girl, "or
someone may become suspicious."
</p>

<p>
Vagn nodded.  "That's right.  Well, we
won't see you till we come for you, then!"
</p>

<p>
"All right," laughed Astrid, as they left.
"Good-by, till then!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER V.
<br /><br />
THE ESCAPE FROM THRANDHEIM.
</h3>

<p>
That night the two boys watched, and
discovered that their guard was
changed at midnight, so they decided
to make the attempt as soon as the guards
were changed, as this would give them
more time to get away safely.
</p>

<p>
The two succeeding days passed slowly,
and the boys spent them in wandering
about the town.  They excited no attention,
as in the harbor were one or two Danish
ships, a vessel from England, and another
from Iceland, both of the latter being
trading ships wintering in Norway.  Sigurd
could not repress a shudder as once they
passed the gloomy temple of Thor.
</p>

<p>
"When will these people ever become
Christian?" he said to his cousin, as they
gazed at the massive stone portal.  "Should
we really conquer Norway, let our first
deed be to tear down this blood-stained old
place, and erect in its stead a temple to
Christ!"
</p>

<p>
"Aye," corrected Vagn.  "'If!'  A vow
is an easy thing, Fairhair, to make, but
a hard one to fulfill.  Norway has many
chiefs as noble as Jarl Hakon, and no
country can be conquered against its will
while there is one to lead the people against
the invader.  King Svein, or his son
Canute, may well take England, for Ethelred
is a cruel and hated king; but I misdoubt
that we shall ever come to Thrandheim
as conquerors."
</p>

<p>
On the second evening, when Harald
came to lock them in their room, he
grumbled, "If it were not for you two, I
would be with the Jarls now.  It will soon
be all up with your Jomsborgers now!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, what do you mean?" cried Vagn.
"Eirik hasn't come here yet!"
</p>

<p>
"Nor will he," rejoined Harald, as he
shot the bolt.  "He passed outside the
Firth to-day with sixty ships, and will join
his father by to-morrow night at More."
</p>

<p>
"How many ships will both Jarls have?"
called out Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
The man paused in the hallway.  "Close
onto two hundred, for Hakon took seventy-four
south with him, and he will collect
as many more in the south."
</p>

<p>
As the man's steps died away the two
boys stared at each other in dismal silence.
</p>

<p>
"Too late, Sigurd!"  Vagn's voice broke.
</p>

<p>
"Not yet," contended Sigurd, stoutly.
"Ulf said that the 'Otter' was fast enough
to pass Eirik, and besides, our own fleet
may not have come so far north yet.
Never give up!"
</p>

<p>
"That's true," granted Vagn, "for the
men will probably want to land and
plunder.  Well, there may be hope yet."
</p>

<p>
They stood watch and watch until midnight;
then, after the relieved guard had
retired, Vagn nudged Sigurd and the
latter emitted a long, dismal groan.
</p>

<p>
At the second groan the man outside
stirred; at the third he undid the bolts,
and said, "Here, what's wrong?  Are you
sick?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd groaned again, muttering something,
and the man entered.  As he did so,
Vagn threw his cloak over his head while
Sigurd sprang at him.  For an instant he
struggled furiously, but the cloak stifled
him, and soon he was lying bound on the
floor, while the boys darted off down the
hall.
</p>

<p>
Silently they made their way down to the
women's quarters, meeting no one.  The
man before Astrid's door was half asleep,
and they secured him with only a slight
struggle.  As they did so, the door opened
and the girl came out, a dark cloak over
her kirtle.
</p>

<p>
"Good!" she whispered, as she saw the
man lying bound.  "I'm all ready."
</p>

<p>
They gained the street without mishap,
and ran at top speed down the hill to the
harbor, without meeting a person.  Arriving
at the waterside, they found the
"Otter's" boat awaiting them, with Ulf
himself on the shore, wrapped in a cloak.
</p>

<p>
As they rowed out to the ship, Vagn
told Ulf how they had escaped, and as they
reached the "Otter," Ulf leaped on deck,
crying in a low tone, "All ready men!
Slip the cable and out oars."
</p>

<p>
The oars, already muffled, were run out,
and the men soon made the "Otter" move
briskly through the water, the faint
starlight serving to guide them through the
shipping.  A little later they gained the
open Firth, and the huge square sail was
hoisted.  They were at last on their way
home!
</p>

<p>
"Well, that is the last I will see of
Thrandheim for many a day."  declared
Ulf, as they watched the shores flit by.
"It will not matter much, though.  There
is little to be gained in trading from this
country, and next voyage I think I will go
to England or Flanders.  Now, don't you
want to turn in?  I have made the cabin
ready for the Lady Astrid, and I suppose
that you can turn in with the men, as
I will."
</p>

<p>
By morning they were well down the
coast, and as the "Otter" was a notably fast
ship, Ulf had no fear of pursuit.  All day
they sailed south, and at evening the ship's
prow was turned out to sea.
</p>

<p>
"Eirik's fleet passed down yesterday
afternoon," explained Ulf, "and we do
not want to run into them.  If the wind
holds fair we will be nearly opposite
Hiorunga Firth by morning, and will turn
in to the coast then."
</p>

<p>
When the boys wakened in the morning
they saw that the "Otter" was indeed
heading east, but a thick fog lay over the
sea and the wind had dropped, the "Otter"
being propelled by her oars.
</p>

<p>
"We are near the coast," declared Ulf,
"and as the sun must be just rising this
fog will blow away before long."
</p>

<p>
Suddenly, as they forged slowly ahead,
the helmsman hailed Ulf, who sprang into
the forecastle.
</p>

<p>
"Come hither, friends," he called to the
boys, and pointing ahead, "what is that
yonder?"
</p>

<p>
There, ahead of them, it seemed as
though many lights were burning dimly
through the mist.  For a few minutes they
gazed, puzzled; then Vagn gave a cry.
</p>

<p>
"Turn her prow, quickly!" he shouted to
the helmsman.  "Those are not fires at all!
That is a fleet yonder, and the fog where
they are must have cleared off, so that
the sun shines on the gilded dragon-prows!
That is what we see!"
</p>

<p>
It was too late, however, for a few minutes
later the fog cleared off around them,
and not a mile away they saw the high
cliffs of Norway; while, farther off,
gleamed the white sails of a great fleet of
ships.
</p>

<p>
"Which fleet is it?" cried Sigurd, his
heart leaping.
</p>

<p>
"I know not," responded Ulf.  "We
must run in and take our chance.  If the
worst comes to the worst, we can outrun
them, for the wind is coming up strongly.
Now for breakfast."
</p>

<p>
They ate a hurried meal, while the
"Otter" plowed on swiftly through the
waves.  At the end of an hour Vagn, who
was watching from the forecastle, cried out
in joy.  "It is our own fleet!  I see a sail
with a red cross!"
</p>

<p>
"That is Hiorunga Firth, there to the
north," declared Ulf, as Astrid joined them
in the prow.  "See, the fleet is heading
in toward it, and we may be in time yet,
for we will be up with them in half an hour."
</p>

<p>
In less than that space of time, indeed,
they had come so near that they could
make out the individual ships, and as they
all knew Jarl Sigvald's ship by sight, Ulf
steered toward that division.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-023"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-023.jpg" alt="As they all knew Jarl Sigvald'a ship by sight, Ulf steered toward that division." />
<br />
<i>As they all knew Jarl Sigvald'a ship by sight, <br />
Ulf steered toward that division.</i>
</p>

<p>
What a sight it was!  Ship after ship,
with their gayly painted sails and glittering
prows, in the shape of birds and beasts, all
crowded with armed men, while, far ahead,
shone the sails of more.
</p>

<p>
"That looks strange, Vagn," said Sigurd,
uneasily.  "I do not see any of my father's
ships; it must be that he has pressed ahead,
and may fall into Sigvald's trap!"
</p>

<p>
A few minutes later the nearest ship
hailed them, and as the Jomsvikings
recognized Vagn and Sigurd a mighty shout
went up, which rolled from ship to ship as
the news spread through the fleet, and amid
a roar of war-horns and clashing of arms,
the "Otter" drew up to the ship of Jarl
Sigvald, the oars being hastily drawn in,
and Vagn leaped aboard, followed closely
by Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
Sigvald was overjoyed at their escape,
but there was no time for telling the story
now.  Vagn swiftly described the plot of
Jarl Hakon, and a yell of rage arose from
the men who had crowded around.  It was
echoed from the other ships, who had
drawn in, as the helmsman shouted out the
tidings.
</p>

<p>
"We have no time to lose, then," cried
Sigvald, "for Bui has gone ahead and has
landed men to plunder."  He turned to the
"Otter."  "Ulf," he shouted, "keep the
Lady Astrid on board, and wait for three
days at the midmost of the Herey Isles, a
mile or two south.  If you hear no news of
us by then, fly with all speed to King
Svein."
</p>

<p>
Ulf waved his hand, and with a last
good-by the boys parted from Astrid as the
ships were cast asunder.
</p>

<p>
"I will put you on board your ship,"
exclaimed Sigvald to Vagn, "as we go.
Up sail!  Out oars!"  He seized his great
war-horn and blew a mighty blast.  The
men sprang to their places, and as they
passed through the fleet cheer after cheer
went up for the plucky boys who had
brought the news.  Hastily sails arose
again and blades flashed out in the morning
sun, for Bui, who had landed ahead of
the fleet near Hod Island, must be warned
at once.
</p>

<p>
They drew alongside Vagn's ship, and
the two boys sprang on board.  Vagn's
men, who had followed his father and
grandfather in many a hard fray, went wild
at the sight of him, and greeted Sigurd no
less heartily.  But Fairhair was worried
about his father, who he knew was over-rash,
and suddenly he heard the helmsman
give a great cry of dismay, and saw him
wave his arms.
</p>

<p>
"What is it?" he cried, as he dashed up
the ladder, followed by Vagn.  But there
was no need of words.  There, cutting
swiftly around the end of Hod Island
toward Hiorunga Bay, was the division of
Bui, in mad haste.  He had fallen into the
trap!
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap06"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VI.
<br /><br />
HIORUNGA BAY.
</h3>

<p>
"Forward!"  Jarl Sigvald's war-horn
rang out its command, and
the fleet pressed on to support
their rash chief.  Sigurd gave a groan of
dismay, but Vagn encouraged him.
</p>

<p>
"He won't be taken, Fairhair, but will
return when he sees the trap.  Nevertheless,
we have fallen into it, for Sigvald cannot
back out now with honor; we must go
forward and fight like Jomsborg men!"
</p>

<p>
Bui's ships disappeared around the
north end of Hod Island; then, as Sigvald
got his fleet into battle array, with each
half-dozen ships lashed side by side, they
came back into sight, with lowered sails
and oars lashing the waters to spray.
</p>

<p>
The ship of Bui was the first to reach
the fleet, and as he stood in the forecastle
and shouted of his discovery, Sigvald
checked him, and ordered him to form his
battle-line behind the fleet.  Bui rowed past
Vagn's ship, and as he did so Sigurd sprang
on the rail, with a shout.
</p>

<p>
There was no time for stopping, so his
father only waved his hand in passing, and
called out, in joy and surprise, "Skoal,
Sigurd!  Use your best weapons to-day!"
It was the last word Sigurd ever had with
his father, Bui of Bornholm.
</p>

<p>
As the fleet moved forward slowly, one
by one the ships of Bui straggled back and
formed behind Sigvald's line.  The Jomsborg
men might have fled still, but they
scorned to do that, and it was against their
laws.  The day was clouding up now, and
as they turned the headland into the bay,
the wind suddenly changed and blew dead
against them&mdash;and there, moving on them,
lay the Norse fleet!
</p>

<p>
Spreading out like a great crescent,
glittering with oars and steel, Hakon's fleet
moved forward, while Sigvald broke his
array into three parts.  Vagn Akison, by
virtue of his father's place and his own
renown, commanded a third part of the
ships; beside his vessels lay those of Bui,
while Sigvald commanded the last twenty.
</p>

<p>
"Look, Vagn!" cried Sigurd, as they
watched the Norsemen, still a half-mile
distant, "they are breaking up likewise!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied Vagn bitterly, "but there
must be nearly two hundred ships there,
crowded with men.  That means sixty or
seventy against each of our divisions of
twenty!"
</p>

<p>
Then, leaping into the waist, Vagn
distributed the byrnies, or shirts of woven
steel rings, and opened several chests of
swords and axes, so that the men could get
at them.  He and Sigurd were fully armed,
and naught remained but to await the attack.
</p>

<p>
It was not long in coming.  Jarl Hakon's
banners were suddenly raised, with a great
burst of war-horns, and a flight of stones
and arrows fell among the Jomsborg ships.
Sigvald's banner was run up likewise, and
his men replied, but the Norsemen had the
advantage, for the wind was with them, and
fast rising to a gale.  Nevertheless, the
Jomsvikings shot well, and occasioned great
confusion among their foes, for their long,
sharp shafts pierced shield, byrnie and body.
</p>

<p>
As the two fleets drew together, most of
the bows were flung aside, and the
spear-racks were emptied.  Sigurd and Vagn,
standing on the high forecastle with their
chosen men, plied their weapons fast; but
a minute later, with a crash that nearly
threw them to the deck, the fleets came
together.
</p>

<p>
"Concentrate on the ship against us!"
shouted Sigurd, and a hail of spears poured
into the large ship whose prow ground into
that of Vagn's.  The Norsemen strove to
board, but a terrible burst of weapons met
them, and an instant later Sigurd gave a
cry of joy.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  We will win yet!"  Vagn
echoed the cry, for their attacker was
slowly withdrawing.
</p>

<p>
"Cast a grapnel on them!" ordered
Vagn, and as the Norse ship was secured
he leaped into her, followed by Sigurd and
his forecastle men.  The Norsemen gave
way, but as the Jomsvikings pressed
forward a new burst of horns arose, and into
the press sailed a dozen fresh ships.
</p>

<p>
"Back for your lives!" called Sigurd, as
he saw a crowd of the enemy pouring
aboard.  "Back to our ship!"
</p>

<p>
They could see nothing of the battle on
either hand, for they were surrounded by
the Norse ships; but as they gained the
deck of their own vessel they heard a wild
shout from Bui's ships, and again the Norse
line shrank backward.  As Sigurd looked
around, he saw Jarl Hakon's ship just
behind their own.
</p>

<p>
"Look there, Vagn!  Order the men to
turn their spears on Hakon!"
</p>

<p>
Vagn did so, and a storm of spears and
arrows poured upon the Jarl's ship.  He
stood proudly in the forecastle, and for a
moment the rain of weapons almost hid
him; then he reappeared, smiling, but his
armor was ripped to pieces, and he shook
himself free of it.
</p>

<p>
Now a fresh burst of foemen bore down
on Vagn's division, and only the higher
sides of the vikings' ships saved them.
Men were falling fast, but as yet the
vikings had not suffered nearly so much as
had the enemy.  The fighting had not yet
become hand to hand, and in the thickly
crowded Norse ships not a Jomsborg spear
failed of its mark, and the trained skill of
the vikings told heavily against the
unskilled levies of Hakon.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Sigurd laughed, and staggered.
"What means the laugh, Fairhair?" called
Vagn, who was directing his men in the
waist.
</p>

<p>
"An arrow, but in the arm only," replied
Sigurd.  A shaft had pierced his arm, just
above the elbow, but he snapped off the
barb and drew it through the wound, and
continued fighting.  The next moment,
however, another arrow flew past his head
and was buried in the rail behind him; a
third followed it, glancing from his helmet.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd realized that someone was aiming
at him steadily, and marking the direction
from which the arrows came, he saw the
face of Thorkel Leira in one of the ships
below.  The man was just aiming a fourth
shaft, half covered by the shield of a
follower.
</p>

<p>
Catching the arrow on his shield, Sigurd
flung a spear in reply, with all his force.
The weapon struck full on the shield that
covered Thorkel, pierced it, and Thorkel
staggered back.  A fresh attack drew
Sigurd's attention, however, and when he
looked for Thorkel again, his ship had
withdrawn.  Now there happened a strange
and terrible thing.
</p>

<p>
The day had steadily grown darker, with
a rising wind.  Suddenly a blaze of lightning
fell athwart the sky, and Jarl Hakon's
ship stood forth in the sight of all, wrapped
in lambent flame, the Jarl himself standing
triumphantly in the stern, grasping a
hammer like that of Thor.
</p>

<p>
A cry of horror arose from the Jomsvikings,
who took the figure for that of the
war god; and the lightning was followed
by a thick hail, the stones as large as eggs,
which burst full in the faces of the
Jomsborg men.
</p>

<p>
"Thor with us!  The gods fight for us!"  An
exultant shout pealed upward from the
Norse host, who pressed onward with
renewed vigor.  All at once a cry broke from
Vagn, a cry of anger and dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Sigurd!  Look yonder!"
</p>

<p>
There behind them Jarl Sigvald had cut
the lashings of his ships and was fleeing!
The Jomsborg men seemed wild with terror,
for now they thought that Hakon was
right, that Thor and Odin were in truth
fighting for him, and they lost heart.
</p>

<p>
Sigvald's ship cut through the press close
behind that of Vagn, and as it passed the
boy called out:
</p>

<p>
"Sigvald!  Turn and fight!  Turn and fight!"
</p>

<p>
But Sigvald only urged his men to greater
efforts, and the sail was run up.  At this
Vagn seized a spear from the deck, and
with a curse hurled it at the fleeing Jarl.
The spear missed him, but struck down the
helmsman at his side, and the ship was gone
from sight in a moment.
</p>

<p>
Louder and louder pealed the war-horns
of Hakon, as ship after ship followed
Sigvald in his flight.  Vagn's men gave one
angry yell, then fought on in silence.
Presently their attackers drew back for
breathing-space, and as they did so the boys saw
Bui's ships close at hand.
</p>

<p>
Bui was without hope, but he was true
to his vows, and fought on stoutly.  The
Norse ships gave way before his onset, and
with a shout of triumph Bui's men cut their
lashings to pursue.  It was a fatal error;
for even as they did so fresh Norse ships
drove down on them, broke their solid front,
surrounded them and began to pour in
boarders.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd, watching helplessly, saw the
Norsemen sweep aboard and slowly clear
the deck; Bui retreated to the forecastle
with a few of his men, but he was
surrounded now, and his foes closed in.  The
old warrior fought on steadily; Sigurd
caught a glimpse of his father in single
combat with a gigantic Norseman,
wielding an axe.  Bui slipped, and the axe
whirled above him and fell on his helmet,
wounding him terribly; but recovering, Bui
cut down his foe, then leaped to the rail.
</p>

<p>
"Overboard, all Bui's men!" rang out his
voice, loudly.  Just then the fight closed in
on Vagn afresh, but Sigurd caught a flash
of armor, and knew that his father had
died as a viking should, beneath the waves.
</p>

<p>
The Jomsborg ships broke up now, each
fighting desperately to the last.  One by
one they were boarded and swept clean of
men, and at length it came the turn of
Vagn's ship.
</p>

<p>
Then, as the Norsemen swept over the
side, the vikings put sword and axe in play
for the first time, the boys at their head.
Time after time the flood poured across the
bulwarks, and time after time the Jomsborg
steel stemmed the tide and drove it back.
At last a wild yell arose behind them, and
those of the crew who were left retreated
slowly to the forecastle, fighting desperately.
</p>

<p>
A very handsome man, of lofty stature,
swept over the prow with his men, and cut
his way to Vagn.  The two met with a
clash of swords, and the tall man, evidently
a leader of note, fell beneath Vagn's blows;
he was up again, however, and his men
swiftly closed around Vagn.  Sigurd gave
a shout of rage, and sprang to his friend's
side, but too late.
</p>

<p>
The sea of fierce faces swept down on
him, but recoiled before the Jomsborg axes.
Vagn lay motionless, and Sigurd, bestriding
his body, faced the handsome leader,
axe in hand.  The other's sword flashed,
and for a moment Sigurd was hard put to
it to ward off the storm of blows; then his
axe fell on the other's helm, and the man
staggered back.  Before he could follow up
his advantage, Sigurd slipped in a pool of
blood&mdash;he saw a sword whirled above him,
gave his battle-cry once more&mdash;and sank
across the body of Vagn.
</p>

<p>
With the fall of Vagn and Sigurd, the
battle was over.  Thirty-five ships had fled
with Sigvald, twenty-five had remained
with Bui and Vagn.  One by one they were
boarded and cleared, for Jarl Hakon gave
no quarter; one by one they floated out of
the whirl, empty but for dying and dead.
The vikings died beneath sword and spear,
or followed Bui's example and plunged
beneath the waves, while far in the distance
the white sails of Sigvald glittered awhile
and then vanished to the south.

<h3>
CHAPTER VII.
<br /><br />
HOW VAGN KEPT HIS VOW.
</h3>

<p>
"That is all, I think; twenty of
them.  No, this one stirred
somewhat.  Here, lift him up."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd opened his eyes.  Over him were
bending two men, one his handsome opponent,
the other&mdash;Thorkel Leira.  The boy
struggled to his feet, the former assisting.
</p>

<p>
It was only mid-afternoon, the storm
had passed, and about the Jomsborg ships
lay the Norse fleet.  Glancing around,
Sigurd saw the decks heaped with dead,
and in the waist of the ship was a little
group of Jomsvikings, their arms bound.
Then he remembered Vagn.
</p>

<p>
Thorkel Leira was holding a horn of
water to Vagn's lips, and as Sigurd, weak
and dizzy, knelt at his friend's side, he
wondered why Thorkel thus aided his
deadly enemy.  He was soon to know.
</p>

<p>
Vagn looked up.  As he caught sight of
Thorkel he dashed the horn aside and
struggled up on Sigurd's arm.  Before he
could speak, however, a group of men
approached and bound the boys' arms, under
the orders of the handsome chief.  Then
they were led into the waist of the ship
and joined the others.
</p>

<p>
The men gave a murmur of joy.  "It
was a noble fight, eh, Vagn?" muttered an
old viking, Biorn of Bretland, or Wales.
"I have fought for twenty years under your
father Aki and your grandfather Palnatoki,
and I never saw a greater battle than this."
</p>

<p>
"It is a sad one for the brotherhood,
Biorn," replied Vagn weakly, "when the
Jarl himself turned tail and fled."
</p>

<p>
A murmur of anger ran around the
group, then Sigurd asked, "Who is the tall
man, and what will they do with us?"
</p>

<p>
Biorn nodded toward some small boats
near by.  "They are taking us on shore, I
know not why.  Neither do I know the man."
</p>

<p>
A group of Norsemen approached, and
the captives were led to the boats, which
were swiftly rowed to the shore.  Here,
upon a long fallen tree, sat the Jomsborg
men, with their feet bound in a long rope;
but their hands were left free.
</p>

<p>
The Norsemen surrounded them, binding
up wounds, exchanging rough jests on
the battle, and examining with awe and
wonder these vikings whose name was so
famous, and who had fought so stoutly
against such great odds.
</p>

<p>
Presently the tall man and Thorkel
Leira landed.  "I have it, Sigurd!" cried
Vagn.  "That handsome man must be Jarl
Eirik, Hakon's son!"
</p>

<p>
At that instant the handsome man came
up to the captives.
</p>

<p>
"You fought well and stoutly, Jomsvikings,"
he said, "and I am in truth sorry
that Jarl Hakon has ordered that no quarter
be given, for I would fain spare your
lives if I might."
</p>

<p>
"It is the fortune of war," replied Vagn,
smiling bravely.  "Had we conquered, I
do not think that Sigvald would have
spared Hakon either, yet Christian men
have more merciful customs than you who
follow Thor and Odin."
</p>

<p>
The other flushed slightly, turning to
Thorkel.  "It is not to my taste, Thorkel,
to slay these helpless men thus."
</p>

<p>
Thorkel smiled his cunning, cruel smile.
"It is much to my taste, Jarl, to slay Vagn
Akison!"
</p>

<p>
At this Vagn cried out, "Yet you feared
to stand before me in battle, Thorkel!  Say,
will you loose my bonds and meet me now
with sword or axe?"
</p>

<p>
A murmur of assent arose from the
Norsemen who stood around, but Thorkel
shook his head, as he fingered the big axe
in his hand.
</p>

<p>
As Thorkel withdrew to speak with the
handsome man for a moment, old Biorn
leaned over and whispered excitedly to
Sigurd: "It is just a chance, Fairhair, so
try it."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded as Thorkel returned.
"Best begin with the chiefs, Thorkel," he
cried, although his heart beat madly, for
if Biorn's plan did not work nothing could
save his life.  Thorkel advanced and stood
in front of him.
</p>

<p>
"Since you are in haste to die, let it be
so."
</p>

<p>
"Wait!" exclaimed Sigurd, as the man
swung his axe aloft.  "Let someone hold my
hair, lest it be defiled and soiled."
</p>

<p>
A Norseman, with a word of admiration
at the lad's bravery, stepped forward and
gathered up the boy's long, fair hair in his
hands, and the axe swung.
</p>

<p>
As it descended, Sigurd jerked his body
so strongly to one side that the axe was
buried in the earth, and Thorkel lost his
balance and fell forward.  A laugh went
up from the crowd as the angry man rose,
but the handsome chief advanced and held
his arm.
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, handsome lad?"
</p>

<p>
"I am called Sigurd, and am Bui's son,"
replied Sigurd, looking up to the other's
eyes, which met his in admiration.  "The
Jomsborg men are not yet all dead!"
</p>

<p>
"Truly you are a son of Bui!" exclaimed
the other.  "Will you take life and peace
from me?"
</p>

<p>
"If you have the power to give it,"
answered Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
The man drew himself up.  "He offers
who has power to give&mdash;Jarl Eirik Hakonson."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Jarl," replied Sigurd, with a
breath of relief, "I will accept it."  The
whisper of old Biorn had proved true.
</p>

<p>
Thorkel, with a dark frown, plucked up
his axe, and cried angrily, "Though you
spare all these men, Eirik, Vagn shall not
escape me!"
</p>

<p>
With that he raised the axe.  As the
weapon whirled, Biorn flung himself
against Thorkel's knees.  The man stumbled,
the axe fell; and Vagn, springing up
in a flash, seized it and fulfilled his vow.
</p>

<p>
A great shout of applause rang out, for
above all things Norsemen love a brave
deed.  They crowded around admiringly,
and Jarl Eirik with a smile, said, "Will
you also take life, Vagn?"
</p>

<p>
"That I will," answered Vagn, "if you
will also give it to my men as well."
</p>

<p>
"Loose them from the rope," commanded
the Jarl, and it was done.
</p>

<p>
By this time evening was coming on, and
the Norsemen hastily made a camp on the
shore; Jarl Hakon was encamped across
the bay.  The men sat around the fires and
talked in low tones, and presently the two
boys were summoned to the fire of the Jarl.
</p>

<p>
Eirik greeted them with a winning smile.
"Sit down and eat, friends, for I have
somewhat to think over.  My father gave
express commands that no Jomsviking was
to be spared; why I gave you life I know
not, save that you were but boys, and full of
courage.  Now, whither would you go?"
</p>

<p>
Vagn looked at Sigurd.  The latter
nodded, and Vagn told Eirik the story of
Ulf and Astrid, who were waiting a few
miles away.  When he finished the Jarl
sat in thought for a moment.
</p>

<p>
"Here is my counsel.  If I send you both
off together, my father will send a ship
after you to slay you, and I will not have
my promise broken.  I go home from here
by land to the mountains, and so to my own
earldom.  I would advise that you, Vagn,
come with me, for I can protect you, and
let Sigurd rejoin Ulf with the eighteen
Jomsvikings who are left.  I will send you
home, Vagn, within a month at most."
</p>

<p>
"That is a good plan," exclaimed Vagn.
"Do you not think so, Fairhair?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd assented, though he disliked to
part with his cousin; but there was no help
for it, and so it was decided.
</p>

<p>
Early the next morning the Jomsborg
men and Sigurd ran out three small boats
and said farewell to Vagn.  Eirik armed
them all well, and made them many presents;
and as they pushed off Vagn stood on
the shore, waving farewell.
</p>

<p>
"I'll see you at Jomsborg next month,"
called Sigurd.  "Farewell!"
</p>

<p>
Under a fair wind the three boats ran
quickly down the bay, rounded the end of
Hod Island, and arrived in an hour at the
Herey Islands.  Steering in between the
largest and smallest, they reached into the
bay, and there before them lay the "Otter."
</p>

<p>
A shout of greeting came to them, and
as they pulled up to the side Ulf Ringsson
sprang on the rail.
</p>

<p>
"What news of the battle?  Who won?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd pointed to his men, all of them
wounded.  "These are all left of the
Jomsvikings," he replied.  A cry of horror went
up, and Ulf staggered back.
</p>

<p>
"Impossible!  Where is your father Bui,
Jarl Sigvald, Vagn Akison, Aslak
Holmskalle?  They cannot be dead!"
</p>

<p>
"Some are even worse off," said Sigurd,
climbing the rail wearily.  "Vagn is safe,
my father is dead with Aslak, and Sigvald
and his men have fled home again."
</p>

<p>
While Astrid greeted Sigurd, and his
wounded and weary men clambered on
board, Ulf remained stunned with amazement.
"Fled!  Fled!" he muttered.  "The
Jarl himself false to his vows!"
</p>

<p>
He could not believe it; for it was the
most sacred law of Jomsborg that no viking
should turn his back to a foe.  Sigurd told
of the fight, while the excited sailors
questioned his men, and as he finished Astrid
sprang forward.
</p>

<p>
"You are wounded, Sigurd!  See, your
arm is all red, and your head is bloody!"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, bind it up," laughed Sigurd bitterly,
"for the Jomsborg rules are shattered
with the brotherhood forever!"  Then he
reeled, and would have fallen save for the
strong hand of Ulf.
</p>

<p>
They carried him to the cabin, and while
the men set sail, Ulf, who was skilled as a
leech, extracted the broken arrow-head and
bound up the wound.  The other, on his
head, was not dangerous, and Sigurd soon
fell into a deep sleep, not waking till the
afternoon.
</p>

<p>
The rocking of the ship told him that
they were out at sea, so he hastened on
deck; to his surprise, the land was out of
sight, and a heavy gale was blowing.
</p>

<p>
"So you are awake!" cried Astrid.  "How
do you feel?"
</p>

<p>
"Ready for another battle," laughed
Sigurd, then his brow clouded over as he
thought of his father.  Astrid, divining his
thoughts, was silent for a moment, then
changed the subject.
</p>

<p>
"We had no sooner left the land than
this gale broke on us, and Ulf says that it
is growing stronger every minute."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd looked around.  Indeed, the gale
was a heavy northeaster, and now he
noticed that the sail was close-reefed, and
that everything was stowed away save the
three boats in which he had come to the
"Otter," which were lashed securely in
the shelter of the high stern.
</p>

<p>
"Hello, I'm glad to see you around so
soon!" cried Ulf cheerily, and the boy
gripped his hand in thanks.
</p>

<p>
"If Jarl Hakon were here, Ulf, he would
say that Ran, the ocean queen, was trying to
complete the work begun by Thor and Odin
at Hiorunga Bay."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd smiled at Astrid, but the captain
looked about anxiously.
</p>

<p>
"We are in for a bad blow, Sigurd.  It
is good that the 'Otter' is stanch, for to
tell you the truth, we are far from our
course for Denmark, and it may well be
that we shall be driven farther still."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap08"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER VIII.
<br /><br />
"SKOAL, TO KING OLAF!"
</h3>

<p>
Much as they loved the keen wind
and dash of the spray, Sigurd and
Astrid were soon driven from their
post in the bow of the "Otter," for the seas
began rolling up tremendously, and they
were forced to seek the shelter of the cabin.
The men were all stowed away below, save
for the watch on duty, and as the "Otter"
was a stanch vessel, and Ulf a good
captain, Sigurd had no fear but that they
would outride the storm safely.
</p>

<p>
"How strange it all seems!" remarked
Astrid that evening.  "Only a few short
weeks ago we were all together at the
heir-ship feast of my uncle, and now the
Jomsborg power is shattered, Vagn is far off in
Norway, and here we are driving no one
knows where, over the sea!  I wonder what
became of your falcon!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd laughed.  "I wonder what!
Never mind, we will soon be back again
with good Queen Gunhild.  Hello! how
goes it, Ulf?"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-031"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-031.jpg" alt="&quot;Never mind, we will soon be back again with good Queen Gunhild.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;<i>Never mind, we will soon be back <br />
again with good Queen Gunhild.</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>
The captain entered, dripping with brine,
and shook his head.  "Badly, Sigurd.  It is
fully the worst storm I ever saw, and I
was a fool for ever putting to sea at this
time of year.  However, we must trust in
God and do our best to weather it."
</p>

<p>
So for five days the "Otter" scudded
before the gale, utterly helpless.  There was
plenty of work for all, however, for the
giant seas swept the low hull repeatedly,
and everyone was kept busy bailing the
ship, from morning to night.  It was lucky,
indeed, that the eighteen Jomsvikings had
come aboard with Sigurd, for as it was all
were so exhausted by the constant labor
that they worked mechanically, and at the
end of every watch they lashed themselves
to the bulwarks and dropped to sleep at
once.
</p>

<p>
On the fifth evening Sigurd was sitting in
the cabin, talking to Astrid, when they were
startled by a loud crash, followed by shouts
and cries.  Sigurd ran out on deck.
</p>

<p>
"The mast!" shouted Ulf in his ear.
Sigurd turned and saw only a ragged stump.
Ulf motioned him inside, for the gale blew
all words away, and when the door was
closed cried in despair.
</p>

<p>
"Sigurd, I have done my best!  Had the
mast held we would have been safe, for the
storm is breaking, I think; but an hour since
I saw land in the west, and we cannot beat
off now."
</p>

<p>
"Know you what land it was?" inquired
Astrid.  Ulf shook his head despondently.
</p>

<p>
"For aught I know, it may be Scotland,
or the Fareys, or the Orkneys, or even
that Vinland which the Icelanders say Eirik
the Red discovered.  I am lost, and we
are in the hands of God."
</p>

<p>
Presently Ulf went out again, and managed
to rig enough canvas to the stump of
the mast to keep the "Otter's" head before
the wind.  In this fashion they drove ahead
all night, and with daybreak a long line of
cliffs was disclosed, straight ahead, and
only a few miles away.
</p>

<p>
As they stood watching on the forecastle,
Astrid pulled at Sigurd's arm.  "Why
can't we escape in those boats, when the
'Otter' drives ashore?" she shouted in his
ear, pointing to the three boats lashed in
the stern.  This had not occurred to Sigurd
or Ulf, because the viking ships themselves
were so small that they rarely carried boats,
as they could be drawn up on shore easily
enough.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  Good idea, Astrid!" Sigurd
hastened to Ulf's side, but the latter
shrugged his shoulders at the plan.
</p>

<p>
"To what end?  We will only be putting
off death for a few minutes; once we drive
on those cliffs and it will be over."
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, at Sigurd's urging the boats
were made ready, for although the storm
was breaking they were fast nearing the
shore.  Into each boat were put arms and
food, well secured.
</p>

<p>
"We must leave before she strikes,"
shouted Ulf, "else the seas will sweep
boats and all away."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded, and returned to Astrid.
The cliffs were not a mile away now, and
they could see the white spray flying high
from the dark rocks.  Presently Ulf
motioned to them, and they descended into
the waist of the ship, joining the crowd
about the boats.  Sigurd took command of
one, Ulf of another, and Biorn of Bretland
commanded the third; then all awaited the
word.  The "Otter" was low in the water
now, and it would be no great task to launch
the boats over her side.
</p>

<p>
Presently Ulf gave a sharp command.
"Out!"  The six men assigned to each boat
lifted it, poised it an instant on the rail, then
as a giant crest foamed along the three
boats were borne out together.  A man
leaped in each, and fended off from the
"Otter's" side with a spear, while the rest
hastily embarked.
</p>

<p>
"Farewell, old Otter!" cried Ulf, the last
to leave; and as they swept from the vessel
they saw her suddenly lurch and reel wildly.
</p>

<p>
"Just in time!" said Sigurd to Astrid,
who was in his boat.  "She struck then, but
scraped over; next time&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
While he was speaking, the ship heeled
far over on her side, amid a cloud of flying
foam; but they could not watch her further,
for now they were fighting for their own
lives.  Sigurd was at the tiller, and he
followed Ulf closely, while the men rowed
steadily.  The seas swept them in under the
cliffs, and Ulf suddenly raised his hand and
waved it.  Straight at the high walls his
boat darted, and then Sigurd saw a little
stretch of beach before them as he swept in.
</p>

<p>
With a last stroke the men drove the
boats up, then leaped out and drew them up.
Sigurd carried Astrid up the beach and
looked around.  The cliffs did not seem so
steep now, and Sigurd realized that they
would be able to climb them, just as Ulf
joined him.  The captain was in more
hopeful spirits now.
</p>

<p>
"Your plan certainly saved us, lady," he
exclaimed to Astrid.  "I had given up
hope&mdash;strange I did not think of those boats
myself.  But we so seldom use small boats
that I never gave them a thought.  Now,
Fairhair, what had we best do?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd looked out to sea, where the hull
of the "Otter" was fast breaking up under
the smashing blows of the waves.  "Well,
I think we had better take the arms and
food from the boats, scale those cliffs, and
see where we are.  We have over a score
of well-armed men, and the folk, whoever
they are, will hesitate before molesting us."
</p>

<p>
Ulf turned and gave the necessary orders,
then, followed by Biorn and the rest, they
made for the cliffs.  These, as Sigurd had
foreseen, offered no great difficulties to the
Norsemen, who were all used to climbing
about their native fiords, and in half an hour
they stood on the brow and looked about.
</p>

<p>
Before them lay a heavily wooded country,
rolling with small hills and valleys, but
without a sign of habitation.  The storm
was nearly over now, and while the seas still
rolled mountain-high below them, the sun
was just breaking through the clouds, and
in the distance they caught the sheen of a
river.  The men hailed the sun with a cry
of delight, and Ulf pointed to the river.
</p>

<p>
"Let us make for that, Sigurd, and there
we can have fresh water and a meal.  After
that we can decide what to do."
</p>

<p>
So, striking away from the sea, they
entered the forest.  It was the end of autumn
now, and though the leaves had fallen from
many of the trees, the forest was composed
in great part of pines, fresh and green.
Even Biorn looked puzzled as he tried to
make out the country.
</p>

<p>
"I do not think it is Scotland," he said,
"and certainly it is neither the Fareys nor
the Orkneys.  It is not my own land of
Wales, for that was far from our course;
it might be Ireland, but I have never been
in that land."
</p>

<p>
"Ireland!" cried Astrid.  "Why, isn't
that where men say Olaf Tryggveson is king?"
</p>

<p>
"So it is," rejoined Sigurd, "but it must
be a wide land, and we have small hope of
finding Northmen here."
</p>

<p>
"Well," remarked Ulf, "we can but push
on boldly.  If we are indeed in Ireland, we
are lucky, for men say that in that country
there is the finest civilization in Europe&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"There used to be, Ulf," growled old
Biorn, "just as there used to be in Wales,
my own land; but the heathen vikings have
well-nigh destroyed it all."
</p>

<p>
Soon they come out on the banks of a wide
and sluggish river, and with cries of joy the
men rushed down to the bank and plunged
in, drinking greedily and washing the salt
brine from their bodies.  Sigurd filled a
horn for Astrid, but as she returned it a
shout broke from Biorn:
</p>

<p>
"Back!  Back!  Out swords, men!"
</p>

<p>
At the same moment a flight of arrows
fell among the men, striking down two of
the sailors, and a wild yell reëchoed from
the trees.  The Jomsvikings, protected by
their byrnies and helmets, hastily scrambled
up the bank and fell into line around the
leaders, the others forming behind them.
</p>

<p>
Dark forms flitted among the trees, and
Sigurd called out, "Shield to shield, men!
Hold your spears ready for the word."
</p>

<p>
The vikings' bows were useless, the
strings having been soaked, so they waited
helplessly.  Arrows fell thickly, but Sigurd
covered Astrid with his shield, and they
did no further harm.  Then, with a yell, a
crowd of men broke out of the forest; they
were clad in woolen tunics, a few wore
armor, while all held spears and axes.  As
they charged, Sigurd gave the word.
</p>

<p>
The attackers broke as the heavy
Jomsborg spears sent half a dozen to the
ground; but as they did so a war-horn rang
out behind them, and a voice cried in
Norse, "At them, men!  For the Cross!"
</p>

<p>
Through the forest glades swept a band
of steel-clad men, driving the others
before them in headlong flight.  As pursuers
and pursued vanished amid the trees, their
leader approached the little band of
shipwrecked men.
</p>

<p>
Although Sigurd was tall, he noted with
surprise that this man was a good head and
shoulders above him, and broad in proportion.
His features were frank and open,
his eyes blue and piercing, and his hair was
red-gold, waving over his golden armor.
He wore a blue cloak, a gold helm and
gold-linked byrnie, and on his shield was a great
cross in red.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Christian men?" he asked, as
he drew near, fixing his eyes on Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
"That we are," cried the latter, joyfully.
"Where are we?  Who are you who
rescued us so opportunely?"
</p>

<p>
"You are on the coast of Ireland, and my
city of Dublin is only three miles distant.
These Irish would never have dared come
so near had they not thought me absent
from home on a cruise.  I am Olaf, son of
King Tryggve of Norway."
</p>

<p>
At this the Jomsvikings gazed in wonder
on the handsome chief; then with a blast
on his war-horn old Biorn led the shout:
</p>

<p>
"Skoal to King Olaf!  Skoal!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER IX.
<br /><br />
HOW ASTRID FARED FORTH.
</h3>

<p>
"Thanks, friends!" smiled Olaf,
and Sigurd thought that never in
all his life had he seen so handsome
and kingly a man.  "Who are you,
young sir?  And who are these men?
Truly, I have seldom beheld so fine a set of
warriors, wounded though they are!"
</p>

<p>
"I am Sigurd Buisson of Bornholm,
King, and with me is Astrid of Vendland,
niece of Gunhild of Denmark.  This is Ulf
Ringsson, captain of our ship, and as for
my men, they are the last of the Jomsvikings."
</p>

<p>
"What!"  Olaf's eyes opened in amazement,
and he threw down his weapons.
"Tell me your tale, quickly!  I heard of
Svein's accession feast, but nothing of what
followed.  Has Sigvald, then, won Norway?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd told of the battle at Hiorunga
Bay, and Olaf's face darkened.  As he
concluded, the Norsemen of Olaf returned and
all took up the march for Dublin, Sigurd's
men mingling with the others.
</p>

<p>
While they walked along Olaf told them
of how he had fled to Russia when his father
was murdered, how he had become a viking,
wandering the ocean, and how he had been
baptized.  Then he had come to Ireland and
won the kingdom of Dublin, ruling it
together with his brother-in-law, Olaf
Kvaran.
</p>

<p>
"We saw your ship from the castle," he
explained, "so I came out to aid any who
might escape.  Now, what do you intend
doing?"
</p>

<p>
"As to that," returned Sigurd, "I care
little; but the Lady Astrid here must be
returned home."
</p>

<p>
"Then will you be my man?" inquired Olaf.
</p>

<p>
"That will I!"  Sigurd turned to his
men and called, "Listen, Jomsvikings!
What say you to taking service with King
Olaf?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye!" the shout went up, with clashing
of arms, and Olaf smiled.  "That pleases
me well, Sigurd, for a few Jomsborg men
are worth a hundred others.  As to Astrid,
she must take her chance; it is too late in
the season for ships now, and I fear she
must remain with us till spring.  However,
that can wait; there is the city."
</p>

<p>
As they left a valley, Dublin lay before
them, and the Jomsborg men cried out in
surprise, for the town was very beautiful,
and defended with strong walls and towers
such as they had seldom seen.  Soon they
were riding through the streets, and the
men were quartered in the palace, where
Olaf also assigned rooms to Ulf, Sigurd
and Astrid.
</p>

<p>
Olaf sent fresh and new garments to
all, and soon they rejoined him in the great
hall for the midday meal.  Here Olaf
introduced them to Queen Gyda, his
brother-in-law, and one or two of his chief men,
and soon they were all chatting away
merrily, forgetful of their past troubles.
</p>

<p>
After the meal Sigurd led his Jomsborg
men into the hall, up to the high seat of
Olaf.  Kneeling, Sigurd placed his hands
between those of the King, and swore to
obey him and to be his man.  One by one
the rest followed his example, and when
the ceremony was over Olaf presented each
man with a shield, ornamented with a large
red cross; but to Sigurd he gave a
magnificent golden helmet, on top of which was
wrought a dragon in the same metal, its
wings outstretched and sweeping far back.
</p>

<p>
"I won this helm in Russia," smiled the
King, "so see that the dragon bears his
face ever toward my foes!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd was overjoyed with the gift,
which was a helm worthy a king, and
thanked Olaf most sincerely.  The next
day he was given a command in the
court-men, or bodyguard, and took up his new
duties.
</p>

<p>
A week later the first snow fell, but as
Astrid had given up all hope of reaching
home before spring, she did not mind
greatly.  Indeed, Olaf's court was a pleasant
one, and both Sigurd and Astrid enjoyed
themselves immensely.
</p>

<p>
Queen Gyda became very fond of Astrid,
who was a favorite with all because of her
sunny disposition and gay heart.  Sigurd's
wound soon healed, and by Yuletide both
had adjusted themselves to their new
surroundings.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd grew much attached to King
Olaf.  Olaf was high-tempered, but just,
and in warlike exercises no one could equal
him.  Often he would go down to the
harbor, bid his men row out a warship, and
then while the oars were out walk along
them.  Not content with this, he would
sometimes juggle knives or balls, keeping
his balance perfectly.
</p>

<p>
He took great interest in "Fairhair," for
Sigurd's nickname could not be left behind,
and himself added to the store of sword-tricks
the boy had learned in the school at
Jomsborg.
</p>

<p>
Yuletide passed, and a few weeks later
a ship drove into the bay, to the astonishment
of everyone, for the ships of that day
did not often venture on voyages in
winter.  The new arrivals were from Norway,
and were traders.
</p>

<p>
It happened that Ulf had not heard of
the ship, and as he sat at meat that evening
he leaped to his feet suddenly.
</p>

<p>
"What is that man who just passed the
door?" he exclaimed.  The King darted a
swift, keen look at the captain, and replied:
</p>

<p>
"That is Thorir Klakke, who arrived
to-day from Norway with his brother
Ketil, bearing news and goods for trading."
</p>

<p>
"Then beware of him, Olaf," remarked
Ulf, "for I have often seen him in deep
converse with Jarl Hakon.  He is here for
no good, I think."
</p>

<p>
Shortly after this Thorir and his brother
entered.  Both men were short, dark, and
well dressed; but their eyes roved about
constantly beneath their low brows.  Ketil's
face in particular was powerful, yet sullen.
</p>

<p>
Thorir started slightly at sight of Sigurd,
but Olaf greeted him kindly, and he sat
down silently, falling into low converse
with his brother.  For several days nothing
occurred, save that Thorir had frequent
audiences with Olaf; but at every meal
Sigurd noted Ketil's gaze fixed on himself
or Astrid, although it dropped before that
of Sigurd.  This puzzled him, for he could
not see why Ketil should be interested, and
it also angered him, for he saw plainly that
Astrid did not like it.
</p>

<p>
A week or two after the arrival of the
Norsemen, Olaf and Sigurd were talking
together, while Astrid and the Queen were
busy with their sewing.  Suddenly the King
exclaimed, abruptly:
</p>

<p>
"Sigurd, how would you like to visit
Norway next summer?"
</p>

<p>
The boy started, meeting the King's eye
eagerly.  "Nothing better, my lord!"
</p>

<p>
Olaf smiled.  "Well, Thorir urges me to
take the realm of Norway from Hakon, as
is my right.  He says that the bonders are
not satisfied with the Jarl's rule and that it
would be an easy task to overthrow him.
What think you?"
</p>

<p>
"Well," responded Sigurd, "if Jarl
Hakon could overthrow the might of Jomsborg,
methinks it would go hard with others
who attempt his kingdom."
</p>

<p>
Here Astrid, who had been listening
earnestly, broke in: "Perhaps, King Olaf,
Hakon might have sent this man to bring
you into his power!"
</p>

<p>
Olaf stared at Astrid for a moment, then
his blue eyes lit up with a fierce light, and
his fist came down on the table.  "As I am
a Christian man, that is it!  Beware,
Thorir Klakke!  If I go to Norway, it
will not be as your master expects!"
</p>

<p>
"Hakon has sixteen Jarls under him,"
remarked the Queen, "and some of them
may not be such great friends of his by
next fall.  If each commands one of the
districts of the kingdom, you may find an
opening in that way, Olaf."
</p>

<p>
The King nodded.  "In any case, I will
take a strong force.  And when I do rule
Norway, I swear by this sword that I will
root out paganism from the land, and bring
the country under the Cross of the white
Christ!  The Hammer of Thor shall vanish
from the land!"
</p>

<p>
For a moment the King's handsome face
was stern, and filled with a high resolve;
then it softened again, as he rose and bid
Sigurd good-night.
</p>

<p>
A few days later the boy felt the bearing
of Ketil becoming intolerable, and he
resolved to warn the man to gaze at Astrid
less insolently.  It was his watch upon the
walls that night, and as he was passing
through the narrow and dark streets, three
men sprang out on him, from a doorway.
Although taken by surprise, Sigurd put his
back to a wall, and drew his sword.
</p>

<p>
His light shield cracked and split under
the furious blows, although the men could
only attack Sigurd singly, for a doorway
on either side of him afforded some
protection.  Knowing that his men were not far,
Sigurd shouted the old Jomsborg call, and
at this the three assailants redoubled their
efforts.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd caught an axe blow on his shield,
which sheared it from his arm; but his
sword fell upon the other's shoulder, and
with a muttered curse the axe fell.  Springing
out, Sigurd clove the helm of the
second man with one quick stroke, but he
received at the same time a tremendous blow
from the sword of the third man.  The
boy staggered, and fell over the body of the
man he had killed; and a loud shout came
from the corner, with torches streaming in
the lane, which put the assassins to flight.
</p>

<p>
The men gave a shout of anger as they
saw Sigurd lying in the street, but the men
had escaped, and Biorn raised Sigurd
tenderly.  The latter, thanks to the gift of
Olaf, was unhurt, but a dent in the side
of the helmet bore witness to the blow's
power.
</p>

<p>
Biorn turned over the body of the slain
man, and the men gave a cry.  "He is one
of the crew of Thorir Klakke!  To the King!"
</p>

<p>
"Stop!" shouted Sigurd as the vikings
were rushing off.  "Let this wait till
morning; they cannot escape, and the King
dislikes to be disturbed from his sleep."
</p>

<p>
They yielded, although unwillingly, and
Sigurd took up his guard again.  This was
to be an eventful night, however, for two
hours after midnight one of the harbor
guards ran up to him, and cried:
</p>

<p>
"Sigurd, Thorir Klakke's ship is leaving,
and will not answer our signals; come
quickly!"
</p>

<p>
Calling to Biorn, Sigurd ran down to the
harbor, and in the dim light could see the
trading vessel, which had not been drawn
up on shore, slowly making her way
toward the harbor entrance, for the port was
too wide to freeze far from shore.
</p>

<p>
Without wasting time in hailing, Sigurd
sprang into a light skiff, moored at the edge
of the ice, set a dozen men at the oars,
and in five minutes was close to the ship.
</p>

<p>
"Way enough, men," he said, then lifted
his voice: "What business have you
leaving Dublin thus?  Come back and give an
accounting!"
</p>

<p>
At this the oars flashed out the faster,
and a mocking voice responded: "What,
indeed, young cockerel?  Go back to
Jomsborg and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Help, Sigurd!  Help!" broke in a cry,
"they have&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Silence fell again, but something flashed
into the water beside Sigurd's boat, and as
Biorn picked it up, the boy exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"That was Astrid's voice!  Alongside, men!"
</p>

<p>
Only a mocking laugh answered, as the
square sail rose and the ship filled away.
"No use," said Biorn.  "Better return;
see, I have picked this up."  He held out
something to Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
Now Sigurd and Astrid both knew the
secret of Runic writing, which only the
priests and high chieftains among the
Northmen were familiar with; and looking
down at the object, Sigurd saw it was a bit
of wood, with something scratched on it.
The light was too dim to see further.
</p>

<p>
"Back to the landing!" cried Sigurd, a
terrible fear in his heart.  "Hasten!"
</p>

<p>
As they drew ashore he leaped out, and
held the piece of wood up to the light of a
torch.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap10"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER X.
<br /><br />
FAREWELL TO DUBLIN.
</h3>

<p>
Biorn and the vikings crowded
around, as he deciphered the scratches,
for they were unable to read Runic,
which was more like shorthand than
anything else.  A cry of dismay burst from
Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
"Listen, men!  'Ketil bears me to
England!  Rescue, Sigurd!'  Come, men, to
the palace!"
</p>

<p>
"To the palace!  To the palace!"  They
echoed his words, and the terrible Jomsborg
battle-yell startled the sleeping town, and
pealed up to the castle.
</p>

<p>
"Bring Thorir Klakke, but harm him
not," commanded Sigurd, "while I arouse
the king."
</p>

<p>
Olaf, however, was already up, wakened
by the tumult.  Sword in hand, he entered
the great hall just as Sigurd burst in at the
other end.
</p>

<p>
"What means this uproar?" roared Olaf,
his eyes blazing with anger.
</p>

<p>
"Justice and vengeance, King!" panted
Sigurd, as he handed Olaf the bit of wood.
Sheathing his weapon with a frown, Olaf
took the object, and by the light of the
torches read the message.
</p>

<p>
"What means it?"
</p>

<p>
"Astrid of Vendland is kidnaped, Olaf,
and I was set upon by three men in the
streets.  One I killed, and he was a man of
Thorir Klakke's&mdash;stay, here is Thorir
now."
</p>

<p>
Biorn and two vikings entered the hall
behind Sigurd, leading the terrified Thorir.
Olaf, grasping the whole situation, strode
up and thundered in the merchant's ear:
</p>

<p>
"What means this night's work?  Where
is your brother?"
</p>

<p>
Thorir stammered out, "Indeed, my lord,
I know not.  Is he not in his rooms?"  Then,
growing bolder, "Am I accountable
for Ketil's doings, Olaf?  What mean you?"
</p>

<p>
Olaf looked into the man's eyes a moment,
and before that terrible gaze Thorir
squirmed helplessly, but did not weaken.
"Begone to your rooms!" said the King,
contemptuously, and turned abruptly to
Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
"Now tell me the tale in full."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd told him of the attack, of the
flight of the ship, and of Astrid's cry, in a
few words.  "I sent men to her rooms," he
concluded.  "Here they come now."
</p>

<p>
Close on his words the men entered,
with them Queen Gyda and some of her
ladies.  Queen Gyda, who had learned the
cause of the tumult from the vikings, told
how a messenger had summoned Astrid
an hour before, saying that Sigurd was
hurt in a brawl, and how the girl had run
out hastily.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, quickly," ordered the
King, and Sigurd followed him to the
ramparts of the castle.  The dawn was just
breaking, and far out at sea they saw a
speck of white.
</p>

<p>
"With Thorir I will deal later, for we
have no proof against him as yet," said the
King, "but that man yonder has dishonored
me, and shall die.  Fairhair, take what men
you will from my courtmen, and the
'Crane,' the fastest longship in the
harbor.  Ketil has taken his brother's ship,
so you should soon come up with him.  The
'Crane' is in the water, and is well
provisioned; so hasten&mdash;be off within the
hour."
</p>

<p>
"Thanks, Olaf!" replied Sigurd.  "I
was about to ask this very thing of you.  I
will take my own men and thirty of yours.
Thanks, for all your kindness, and above
all for your friendship, Olaf!"
</p>

<p>
The King smiled sadly.  "I have few
friends, Sigurd, and methinks you are the
most faithful of them, though the newest.
No, go with God, and forget him not, for
it is still the season of storms."
</p>

<p>
As Sigurd turned away, the King
stopped him with a sudden impulse.
</p>

<p>
"Stay!  Give me your hands."  Wondering,
Sigurd put his hands between
Olaf's.  "Now swear again your oath to
me, Jarl Sigurd!"
</p>

<p>
The boy, overcome by this unexpected
title and honor, stumbled through the oath,
and rose with tears in his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"I need no oath to be faithful, King
Olaf!  When you have won Norway, the
title of friend is all I want."
</p>

<p>
Quick tears sprang to Olaf's eyes also,
and unbuckling his sword-belt, he threw it
over Sigurd's shoulders, saying, "I have
no earldoms yet, but here is my Jarl-gift,
my friend.  Farewell!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd wrung the King's hand, then
turned and ran down the stairway to the
courtyard.  Hastily assembling his men,
and choosing thirty from Olaf's followers,
he sent them down to the "Crane" with
Biorn, and followed them himself a few
minutes later, after bidding Ulf farewell.
The captain would have accompanied him,
but Olaf was sending him on a mission to
an Irish king in the interior.
</p>

<p>
The "Crane," as Olaf had said, was well
stocked with all things needful for a
voyage; so, weighing anchor, the sail was run
up and the voyage begun.  As they left the
harbor, Sigurd told his men of his
advancement, and it was greeted with a shout of
satisfaction; for the Jomsvikings were
proud of their young leader, and the other
men had heard many tales of his bravery.
Indeed, even though the title carried no
lands, it was the ambition of every chief
of good birth to be made Jarl, or Earl, for
the Jarls were second only to the King.
</p>

<p>
The oars were run out, for the wind was
light, and under all speed the "Crane" ran
southward.  Ketil's ship was out of sight,
but his goal was known, and Sigurd was
confident that he would overtake the other
ship before night.
</p>

<p>
"Why, think you, is he heading for
England instead of for Norway?" Sigurd
asked old Biorn.
</p>

<p>
The latter paused a moment.  "Well,
Jarl Sigurd, it is in my mind that Ketil is
a cunning man.  If he took Astrid to
Norway, he would make nothing; but by
taking her to England, much.  King Ethelred
would pay high for such a hostage from
King Svein of Denmark."
</p>

<p>
"Oh, I see!  Then she will not be
harmed?"
</p>

<p>
"Assuredly not, Jarl, at least till she
reaches England, which I trust will never
be.  Ethelred is as treacherous as Hakon
himself, and if she once falls into his
clutches it would be a bad business."
</p>

<p>
They did not come up with Ketil's ship
so soon as Sigurd expected, for not till
mid-afternoon did the helmsman give a shout,
and Sigurd, running to the forecastle, saw
a white speck far ahead.
</p>

<p>
"Lower the sail," he ordered, "and get
out all the oars," for until then only half
the oars had been going, to save the men's
strength.  "We cannot come up with them
to-day," he explained, "so it were best to
let Ketil think himself safe."
</p>

<p>
So the sail was lowered and the "Crane"
proceeded under her oars till nightfall,
when the sail was hoisted again and the
oars taken in.  The wind freshened toward
midnight, when Sigurd relinquished the
watch to Biorn, and at dawn he was
aroused by the old viking.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Jarl!  A squall from the west
has broken on us, and it is daybreak."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd followed him to the deck.  There
he found the sail close-reefed, and the
"Crane" running before a squall of wind
and driving snow.  There was nothing to
be done, however, save to await the sunrise.
</p>

<p>
As full day broke, but dark and gloomy,
with flurries of snow, a shout went up, for
not half a mile distant lay Ketil's ship, also
running before the wind.
</p>

<p>
"Shake out the reefs, men!  We may as
well take chances, and make sure of her."
</p>

<p>
Biorn stopped him, however, and pointing
ahead, showed Sigurd a dull gray line.
"England, Jarl, or Wales, rather!  It
would be useless to try to board Ketil in
this heavy sea; the ships would be smashed
to kindling-wood."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd reluctantly acknowledged that the
old viking was right, so he contented
himself with following the other ship, while
with every hour the Welsh coast grew
plainer ahead of them.  The sky cleared
off, but the sea was still running too high
for any attempt at boarding.
</p>

<p>
"I know where we are, Jarl," called out
the helmsman.  "Do you remember that
great headland, Biorn?"
</p>

<p>
"That I do," exclaimed the viking.
"See how the coast falls away there,
Sigurd?  That is Wales, where live my
own people, and we are entering a great
firth which goes far up into the country,
and on the right is the Saxon kingdom of
Wessex.  I recall it well.  Six years ago
we sailed up and plundered a town they
call Bristol.  It must be that Ketil means
to land along the Saxon coast."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd gazed with interest on the lofty
cliffs, but soon they turned the last
headland, and Ketil pointed his ship due east.
Sigurd saw that they were indeed in a
great firth; the "Crane" easily held her
own with the fleeing ship, but did not
approach closer.
</p>

<p>
"If they succeed in getting ashore,
whither would they take the Lady Astrid,
think you?" inquired Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
"To King Ethelred, doubtless,"
answered Biorn, "at London, in the east.
However, they cannot escape us now."
</p>

<p>
"Arm yourselves, men!" ordered Sigurd,
a little later, "the sea is falling fast, and
we will run aboard."
</p>

<p>
Ketil, however, saw this also, and evidently
resolved to take no chances, for he
turned in toward the coast, plying his oars
desperately.  The two ships, a quarter of
a mile apart, drew into the coast and ran
along the low shores.
</p>

<p>
Suddenly Biorn gave a cry of fury.
"He will escape us yet!"  Ketil's ship,
just beyond a headland, was turned in
toward the shore.  The helmsman turned
the "Crane" and the sail was run down
as the other ship disappeared.  Under all her
oars, the "Crane" darted ahead, and there
before them lay the ship of Ketil, while the
crew were leaping out.  A band of armed
men from the town above ran down and
met Ketil.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd did not wait to see the meeting,
but as the "Crane" scraped on the sand
and ice he leaped overboard, followed by
Biorn, and waded ashore.  Amid Ketil's
party Sigurd had seen the flutter of a dress,
and he knew there was little use searching
the other ship, so he dashed up the hill.
Suddenly, however, a flight of arrows fell
among Sigurd's men, and the shout rose of
"Death to the sea-wolves!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd, with Biorn and another man,
was far ahead of the rest, running at top
speed.  As the sudden attack was made, a
number of Saxons sprang out from ambush
and surrounded the three.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap11"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XI.
<br /><br />
AT ETHELRED'S COURT.
</h3>

<p>
Sigurd flung his hand up and
sheathed his sword.  The Saxons
paused, and one of their number
stepped forward.
</p>

<p>
"You will get little plunder here, vikings,
and many hard knocks," he called, "so you
had best put to sea again."
</p>

<p>
"We are no vikings or sea-wolves,"
answered Sigurd.  "I am Jarl Sigurd
Buisson, one of King Olaf's men from Dublin,
and am in pursuit of these men who fled up
to the town.  Two days since they abducted
a noble lady from Olaf's own castle, whom
I seek to rescue."
</p>

<p>
The Saxon leader gave an exclamation
of astonishment, and at this moment
Sigurd's men ran up and joined him.  The
Saxon bows were raised, but the leader
checked them.
</p>

<p>
"You look over-young to be a Jarl," he
declared, "but if your story is true we have
indeed done ill.  The leader of those men
said he was pursued by sea-robbers, and
that he was on his way to King Ethelred;
so, although he was a Northman, we gave
him safe conduct.  What proof have you
of your tale?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd, who was in despair at this
unexpected check, knew that it was necessary
to win the Saxon over.  "Does my ship
look like a viking dragon?" he said calmly.
"Were we vikings, we would not be abroad
this time of year.  See, I wear the Cross,
and my men are from Olaf's courtmen, as
you may see from their shields and weapons.
We are Christians all, and no followers
of Thor."
</p>

<p>
At this the Saxon stepped up and shook
his hand heartily.  "Your pardon, Jarl, but
I am warden of the coast, and must do my
utmost to defend it from sea-rovers.  I am
Jarl Edmund, and now I recall that in the
other party was a woman, or rather girl."
</p>

<p>
"She is a noble lady of Denmark," said
Sigurd, not thinking it wise to tell Astrid's
real position.  "Now, cannot we follow
these men to the town?"
</p>

<p>
Jarl Edmund turned.  "Of course, but
they told us they were on the King's
business, and I sent a man with them to get
them horses at once.  I am indeed sorry
for this, Jarl."
</p>

<p>
"You but did your duty," replied Sigurd,
"and there is no help for it."  He looked
at Biorn: "What is your counsel, old
friend?"
</p>

<p>
"Ketil will push forward to London,"
replied Biorn, "so I think you had best
follow him with the Jomsborg men, and try to
catch him.  I will take the others and the
'Crane,' and proceed by sea to London."
</p>

<p>
"Good!"  Sigurd turned to Edmund
again.  "I suppose we can procure horses
in the town yonder?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," replied the Saxon, eager to repair
his mistake, "I will myself go with you."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd picked out his old Jomsborg men,
and saying farewell to Biorn, made all
haste to reach the town.  As they entered,
Edmund dispatched several men, one of
whom returned with the news that Ketil's
party had left ten minutes before.  At this
Edmund made a gesture of dismay.
</p>

<p>
"I fear you will not come up with them,
Jarl Sigurd, for they took the best horses
to be found.  However, we will see what
we can do."
</p>

<p>
In half an hour Sigurd and his men were
riding east, Edmund having furnished
them with a guide.  They pushed on for
many days, but found that Ketil kept well
ahead, commandeering the best horses as
he went, on the plea of the King's business.
At Malmesbury and Wantage, Sigurd and
his men were surprised at the size of the
cities and the splendid civilization they
found there, which was far ahead of any
that the north could boast of.  Wessex and
Sussex had not been ravaged by the Danes
for many years, and the country amazed
them by its beauty and fertility.
</p>

<p>
"If these Saxons had kings like ours,"
remarked Sigurd to his men, "King Svein
would have a hard time indeed before he
could take the throne of England."
</p>

<p>
At Reading they found that Ketil was
only half a day ahead of them so they
pushed on to London with all speed,
reaching it in the evening.  Next morning
Sigurd took his way to the palace.
</p>

<p>
Here he gave his name and title to the
chamberlain, and was shown into the
great hall, around which ran a buzz of
astonishment as he appeared.  Sigurd had
filled out amazingly in the last few months,
and was large for his age; he wore his
golden helm, a blue cloth kirtle and waist,
and the great sword that Olaf had given
him, its hilt wound with gold and the
scabbard thick with carved ivory.  As he
walked up the hall, he removed his helm
and let his long golden hair stream over
his shoulders.
</p>

<p>
The chamberlain led him to the high-seat,
and Sigurd knelt a moment before
King Ethelred, then rose.  The king was a
pale, crafty-looking man, and as Sigurd
looked around his heart sank for an instant,
for among the courtiers he beheld the
mocking face of Ketil.
</p>

<p>
After the chamberlain announced his
name and title, the King arose.  "Greeting,
Jarl Sigurd!  The men of King Olaf
are ever welcome at our court, and we look
forward to another visit from himself.
Well I remember Olaf, who spent a year or
two with us, and I would fain see him
again.  You look young to hold a Jarlship
under so great a man!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd answered fittingly, then said,
"My lord King, I ask your aid.  Among
your men I see a certain Norseman, Ketil
Gormson, who not long since abducted a
lady from the castle of King Olaf.  I have
followed him closely, and since he is here,
the Lady Astrid is not far away."
</p>

<p>
King Ethelred looked surprised.  "Why,
what is this?  The man Ketil is a peaceful
trader, and arrived here only yesterday.
He has told me nothing of any lady!"
</p>

<p>
"Nevertheless," replied Sigurd firmly,
"she is with him, and King Olaf sent me
to rescue her.  I must crave your help,
King Ethelred."
</p>

<p>
The king ordered Ketil to stand forth,
which he did, a sly smile upon his face.
Ethelred asked him what he knew of
Sigurd's tale.
</p>

<p>
"Nothing, my lord; I have no woman
with me, and have but just arrived by slow
stages from the west coast where I was
trading."
</p>

<p>
Ethelred looked at Sigurd, and then the
latter knew that he was being made a mock
of.  No doubt the king had Astrid hid away,
intending to hold her for a hostage.
</p>

<p>
"You see, Jarl Sigurd," said the king
softly, "you must have been mistaken in
this man, who is a kind-hearted fellow
indeed.  Anything that I can do to aid you
will be done at once.  Bring your men to
the palace, and you shall be given quarters
here."
</p>

<p>
At these words, and Ketil's mocking
smile, Sigurd lost his temper.  Taking a
step forward, he cried angrily: "There is
no mistake, King Ethelred, and well you
know it!  Think not that you will escape
the heavy hand of Olaf by smooth words,
when he hears of this.  As for you, Ketil,"
Sigurd turned on the man, who shrank
back at his blazing eyes, "take heed to
yourself!  If I meet you outside the palace
I will slay you like the dog you are!"
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-045"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-045.jpg" alt="&quot;As for you, Ketil, take heed to yourself!&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;<i>As for you, Ketil, take heed to yourself!</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>
"You forget yourself, Jarl Sigurd,"
spoke out the king, sternly.  "I have
promised you assistance in this matter, so
bring your men to the palace at once, and
we will have search made for the lady."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd rejoined his men with dismay in
his heart.  He knew only too well that the
King's command meant that he would be
watched closely, and he saw no way of
rescuing Astrid.  When he told the men
the result of his visit to court, they were
as angry as he; but there was no help for
it, and in the afternoon they took up their
quarters in the palace.
</p>

<p>
Ketil took good care to keep out of
Sigurd's way.  The Jomsvikings wandered
freely about the city, staring wonderingly
in the shops, and Sigurd bade them keep a
sharp lookout for Astrid.  The days passed
away, and Ethelred tried to soothe his
visitors by a pretended search of the city, and
by soft words, but at last Sigurd determined
to take matters into his own hands.  It
was now the middle of February, and
Sigurd was impatient to return to King Olaf.
</p>

<p>
Calling his men together after the evening
meal, he said, "Men, if we are to find
Lady Astrid we must do it ourselves.  I
believe she is held here in the palace, in the
woman's wing; do you therefore hang
about that side, pretending to look in the
shops.  I myself will do the same, and
mayhap the Lady Astrid will either see us, or
we will light on some clue."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd was treated with great honor, but
when he went abroad he knew that he was
spied upon closely.  The next day he
visited the shops near the women's
quarters of the palace, and as he sauntered
along one of his men strolled up.
</p>

<p>
"Come with me, Jarl," he whispered.
Sigurd accompanied him, talking and
laughing, and the man said, "Look at the
third window from the end."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd did so, and his heart gave a leap
of joy.  There, hanging from a corner of
the window, was a scrap of blue and gold
cloth that he knew had been taken from
Astrid's scarf.  As he looked up, a face
appeared, but at a quick sign of warning
from him, it vanished.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" he cried, when he had
regained his room, "we have found her,
sure enough!  And now to rescue her."
</p>

<p>
That same evening he heard a wild
shout go up from his men, in the next
room, and a moment later Biorn strode
into his room.  Sigurd greeted him with
unbounded joy, then seeing Biorn's face
half covered with bandages, cried:
</p>

<p>
"What is this?  Wounded, Biorn?"
</p>

<p>
The old viking smiled.  "We met a
Danish ship four days ago, Jarl, and she
stopped to talk with us."
</p>

<p>
"Up to your old tricks, sea-wolf!"
laughed Sigurd.  "What did you talk
about?"
</p>

<p>
"The price of swords, mainly," answered
Skarde.  "The Danes finally decided
that ours were better, so we gave them
Ketil's old trading ship and brought in the
Dane with us; she is brand new, and as fast
as the 'Crane.'  It was hard work, though,
for I had only thirty men, and they were
double that.  We lost ten killed, and half
of us are wounded; but that is no matter.
Now for your story."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd quickly outlined the position of
himself and Astrid.  When he concluded,
Biorn was silent for some time.
</p>

<p>
"It is no light matter, Sigurd, to brave
Ethelred; but I think we had best carry off
the Lady Astrid.  Once aboard the
'Crane,' we would be safe.  But how to
do the business?"
</p>

<p>
"By craft only, Biorn.  Astrid saw me
to-day, and knows we are here.  How to
get a message to her?"
</p>

<p>
"That is easy enough.  Do you write it,
and I will shoot an arrow into her window
to-night."
</p>

<p>
"Good!  I never thought of that."  Sigurd
procured a bit of parchment, and in
a few minutes the message was ready.  "I
told her that to-morrow night we would
wait beneath her window.  She must contrive
to let herself down, and if necessary
we will fight our way down to the 'Crane.'  Is
she below the bridge or above it?"
</p>

<p>
"Below.  I will go down to-morrow and
bid the men be ready to receive us.  We
must get some fresh water on board, too."
</p>

<p>
An hour later Biorn returned.  "The
arrow flew straight, Jarl.  I waited a few
minutes and saw a light cross her shutter
thrice."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded.  "Then she understands.
Get the 'Crane' ready to-morrow, and
return by nightfall.  Better have a boat or
two at the water-stairs, just at the end of
this street."
</p>

<p>
"Trust me, Jarl," said the old viking,
and returned to the ship.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XII.
<br /><br />
THE FLIGHT FROM LONDON.
</h3>

<p>
The return of Biorn and the finding of
Astrid happened so close together
that Sigurd determined to take
advantage of his opportunity.  He saw the
King twice a day, at meals, and on each
occasion Ethelred seated him near the
high-seat and conversed affably with him; but
Sigurd felt that the iron hand was but
concealed within a silken glove, and that the
King would soon find means to rid himself
of this troublesome Northman.
</p>

<p>
The day after Biorn's arrival, at the
noonday meal, Ethelred called Sigurd to his
side as usual.
</p>

<p>
"How is the search progressing, Jarl?
Have you any news yet?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd assumed a gloomy air.  "I only
wish I had some, King Ethelred.  My ship
arrived last night, and I cannot long delay
my return to King Olaf, I fear."
</p>

<p>
The King seemed unmistakably relieved,
and Sigurd judged that his visit to the
shops the day before had not escaped the
spies.  Ketil he had not seen since that
first day, but as he always saw some of his
men whenever he left the palace, he
believed the Norseman was keeping close
watch on him.
</p>

<p>
That evening Biorn entered his room
shortly after dark with a coil of thin but
strong rope and a light grapnel.
</p>

<p>
"Is the 'Crane' in shape?" asked Sigurd
eagerly.  "We had best wait an hour or
two to let the streets get deserted."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, all is ready, and two large boats
are waiting at the stairs.  We are only
three streets from the river, so the escape
is open."
</p>

<p>
"I'm not so sure about that," replied
Sigurd uneasily.  "If Ketil discovers
those boats there, and has been following
you, as is likely, we may have trouble yet.
However, time enough for that when it
comes."
</p>

<p>
An hour later there were few people in
the streets, so Sigurd roused his men and
set out.
</p>

<p>
"We had better not keep together," he
said.  "Three of you, with Biorn, come
with me; the others wait at the corner here.
We will not be long."
</p>

<p>
So the four quickly made their way to the
corner of the palace where Astrid's
window was located.  A high wall enclosed
the palace, with a strip of garden inside;
the palace itself had but two stories, Astrid
being on the upper.
</p>

<p>
As they reached the wall, Biorn flung
up the grapnel, which held, and Sigurd
went up the rope, hand over hand.  Changing
the rope to the inside, he slid down,
and stood beneath the window.
</p>

<p>
All was dark above, but when he threw
up a stone at the shutter, it opened and
something tumbled out.  Catching it,
Sigurd saw it was a rope made of shreds of
curtains; he held it firm, and a minute later
Astrid slid down and stood by his side.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd greeted her with a silent handclasp,
and led her to the wall.  Climbing
up, he drew Astrid to the top, and next
minute both stood in the street.  Old Biorn
greeted Astrid heartily, and threw a dark
cloak over her dress; and without delay
they started for the river.
</p>

<p>
When they met the dozen men left by
Sigurd, he sent them forward with Biorn
to get the boats ready, following with
Astrid.  Ten minutes later they descended
the stairs and pushed off, Astrid and Sigurd
standing in the prow of the first boat.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!  You are free at last, Astrid!"
cried Sigurd, in a low tone.  At the same
instant the girl pulled him sharply
backward, and a spear whizzed under his arm.
A yell arose, and a dark mass in front of
them resolved itself into a large boat full
of men.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd threw all concealment aside.
"Pull, men, pull!" he shouted.  One of the
men sank back with a spear through him,
and with that the other boat crashed into
Sigurd's.
</p>

<p>
Standing in the prow, Sigurd cut with
his sword at the foremost man, while Biorn
endeavored to ward off the other craft.
Then Ketil's mocking laugh sounded in
Sigurd's ears, and as his blow fell harmlessly
on the other's shield, a boat-hook caught
his byrnie and all but jerked him overboard.
</p>

<p>
"You have tough bark, friend Sigurd,"
cried Ketil, as the boy staggered.  Sigurd
tried in vain to free himself from the hook,
as Ketil pulled, so he cried:
</p>

<p>
"Take Astrid on board and set sail, Biorn!"
</p>

<p>
Instead of resisting the boat-hook,
Sigurd gave a leap forward into the prow
of Ketil's boat.  As he did so, Biorn pulled
away, with a cry of dismay from Astrid,
and left Sigurd amid his foes.
</p>

<p>
When the boy sprang on board, Ketil was
pushed back, and he staggered.  Sigurd cut
him down with a single blow, disengaged
the hook from his steel shirt, and looked
around.  He had forgotten the second boat,
and this was right alongside.  Striking
down a second man, Sigurd leaped back
among his own followers.
</p>

<p>
"To the 'Crane,' men!  Follow Biorn!"
</p>

<p>
The men needed no urging, and they
soon caught up with the first boat.  Looking
back, Sigurd saw that they were not
pursued, for the others were demoralized at
the loss of their leader.
</p>

<p>
"All safe, Sigurd?" cried Biorn, as they
came up.
</p>

<p>
"All safe," the boy replied, "and I think
I have paid Ketil for his villainy.  At any
rate he won't bother us for some time.
Row fast, men, there is no use trying to
hide now."
</p>

<p>
Shouts rose on the air behind them, and
they saw torches darting to and fro.  Soon
they passed below London Bridge, and in
a few minutes were aboard the "Crane,"
the men on board sending up a hearty
cheer.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd led Astrid to the cabin, while
Biorn took charge of the ship, whose oars
were already out.  "Now, Astrid, tell me
your story," said Sigurd, as they sat down.
</p>

<p>
"Well, about midnight that night, Ketil
came to my room with a note in Runic
saying that you were wounded and to come at
once.  I thought it strange that you should
send him, but went willingly enough.
</p>

<p>
"As soon as we were outside the palace
his men seized me and carried me on the
ship.  There I was freed, but locked in the
cabin.  I scratched a few words on a piece
of wood, for I heard Ketil say they were
going to England, and then heard you come
up alongside.  I threw the wood out of the
window, and called, but Ketil ran in and
threw a cloak over my head."
</p>

<p>
"After that I was treated well enough.
After we landed, Ketil made me promise
not to escape if he left me free; and when
we got to London King Ethelred was very
nice to me, giving me women to wait on me,
and many gifts."
</p>

<p>
"The villain!" cried Sigurd angrily, and
he told Astrid all the king had said.
</p>

<p>
"I was kept in my room," continued
Astrid, "but I had nothing to complain of.
Then one day I saw you in the shops across
the way, and you know the rest.  I tore up
some curtains to make a rope with, and here
I am."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd laughed.  "Well, shall we stay
here, or go out on deck?"
</p>

<p>
"Out on deck, by all means.  But why
do your men call you Jarl?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd told her of his last interview with
Olaf, and Astrid said, casting down her
eyes: "Well, I suppose after this you will
hold me so far below you that&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense," broke in Sigurd, laughing,
"get on deck and stop this foolery!"
</p>

<p>
Astrid gayly ran out on deck, and Sigurd
followed.  They were speeding swiftly
down the Thames, which is seldom frozen
in winter, and all sound of pursuit was lost.
As there was nothing to be seen in the faint
starlight, Astrid went to bed, Sigurd
giving the cabin up to her, while he took
charge of the ship, Biorn relieving him
after a few hours.
</p>

<p>
At sunrise they were well at sea, and as
there were plenty of furs on board, the
men were warmly clad.  Suddenly Sigurd,
looking back, cried out:
</p>

<p>
"Look there, Biorn!  What ship is that?"
</p>

<p>
The old viking gave a grim laugh, and
then Sigurd recollected the ship which
Biorn had taken on his way to London.
</p>

<p>
"She had only fifteen men in her, Jarl,
for I could spare no more from the
'Crane'; but yesterday I picked up a score
of Norsemen in London, and as they were
willing to take service with Olaf, they are
now on board.  She may come in handy."
</p>

<p>
"Yes, indeed," agreed Sigurd, "and she
is a handsome ship, too.  Where did you
get the men, Biorn?"
</p>

<p>
"Oh!" replied the other, carelessly,
"they were prisoners of Ethelred's, so I
invited them to take a cruise.  They were
not closely watched, so there they are!"
</p>

<p>
"What have you done!" broke out
Sigurd, in dismay.  "Don't you know that
this will bring all the Saxon forces down
on us?"
</p>

<p>
Biorn shrugged his shoulders.  "There
were only two of Ethelred's longships lying
in the water, Jarl, and seeing that they lay
unwatched, some of the men rowed over
last night and all but hewed away their
masts."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd seized the old viking's hand.
"Pardon, Biorn, I might have known you
better.  That explains why we were not
followed; now what shall we do?"
</p>

<p>
"Well, it is madness to put to sea in this
weather, but there is no help for it.  I
would suggest that we either go north to
Mercia or Northumberland and winter
there, or else strike over to Flanders and
go overland to Denmark.  We would be
safe enough in the north of England, for
there are many vikings there and Ethelred's
power is weak, to say the least."
</p>

<p>
"Then let us head for there, gather a
few more men if possible, and strike for
Denmark or else Flanders."
</p>

<p>
This was decided on finally, for Sigurd
wished to take the captured ship with him,
but his men were too few to manage both
vessels in case of danger.  So they coasted
along the shore of East Anglia, then turned
north, past the Wash, and came to the
Humber River.  They met with no storms
on the way, though the weather was cold
enough.
</p>

<p>
Just before reaching the Humber, the
"Crane" stopped at a small river for fresh
water.  There were no habitations in sight,
so Sigurd and Astrid went ashore while
the casks were being filled.
</p>

<p>
"It is good to be on land again, Sigurd!"
cried Astrid, after racing and beating him
to the top of a small hill.
</p>

<p>
"I've been at sea so long that I don't
notice it much," laughed Sigurd spreading
his fur cloak in the snow for Astrid to sit on.
</p>

<p>
As they rested, looking over the broad
expanse of snow, dotted with trees and
forests that spread inland, they heard the
ringing call of a war-horn from the ships.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Astrid!" cried Sigurd, starting
up, "something must be wrong at the
ships!"
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIII.
<br /><br />
ALFRED OF MERCIA.
</h3>

<p>
They dashed down the hill, and in a
few minutes were through the trees
and on the river bank.  They found
Biorn drawing up his men.
</p>

<p>
"Why, what's the matter, Biorn?"
</p>

<p>
"I am not sure, Jarl, but look up the ice
yonder."
</p>

<p>
He pointed up the frozen bed of the little
river, and Sigurd saw a large party of
armed men, pulling a sledge, running
toward them.  Sigurd examined them for a
minute.
</p>

<p>
"I don't think they mean to attack us,
Biorn, or they would not have that sledge.
They look like Saxons, so best be ready."
</p>

<p>
By this time more men had arrived
from the ships, and as the Saxons
approached, Sigurd saw that there were some
fifty men in the party.  Finding the
Northmen waiting, they stopped running, and one,
better dressed than the rest, in a bearskin
mantle and helmet, hastened on.
</p>

<p>
As he came near, Astrid said, "Why,
Sigurd, he isn't any older than you are!
And you were afraid of him!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd made no reply save a smile, for,
indeed, the Saxon was only a youth, but a
noble-looking one.  Nearly as tall as Sigurd,
he was not so broad, but his face was frank,
and attracted the young Jarl at once.
</p>

<p>
"Are you Danes or Norsemen?" called
the stranger.
</p>

<p>
"Norsemen," answered Sigurd, "and
you are Saxons, I take it."
</p>

<p>
"Right you are," laughed the boy, with
a glance over his shoulder.  "Are you
plundering the country?"
</p>

<p>
"Nay," answered Sigurd.  "We are
Christians.  Bid your men stand back, for
our arrows lie loosely on the strings."
</p>

<p>
The boy laughed again, as if it were a
good joke, and turning, waved to his men,
who halted.
</p>

<p>
"Let me explain," he said.  "I am Alfred,
son of Jarl Alfric of Mercia, and with
me is Sigrid my sister.  Briefly, we are
flying from the men of King Ethelred; will
you assist us?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd, suspecting a trap, looked keenly
at the boy; but his gaze was met squarely,
and Sigurd's suspicions vanished.  "Where
is your sister, and your pursuers?" he asked.
</p>

<p>
Alfred pointed to the sledge.  "My sister
is ill, and we have to carry her."  His face
suddenly became serious.  "Hasten your
reply, sir Norseman, for God's sake!  The
King's men are not half a mile behind, and
there are nigh three score of them, while
half of mine are wounded or sick."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd stepped out and gripped his hand.
"No time for talking, then!  Take your
sister and the sick or wounded men out to
my ships, and let all your fighting men join
mine.  Take charge of him, Astrid, and
use the boats quickly."
</p>

<p>
The boy called up his men, dividing them
as Sigurd had ordered, and joining the
Norsemen with twenty Saxons.
</p>

<p>
"We will give Ethelred's men a sharp
lesson, Biorn.  Do you post the men as you
see fit."
</p>

<p>
A hundred yards up the river was a bend,
and running toward this, Biorn motioned
the men to hide behind the dry bushes that
stood along the banks, while he ran forward
to reconnoiter.  A minute later he returned
at full speed.
</p>

<p>
"Here they are," he cried.  "Pass the
word to wait till they come opposite, then
loose arrows and at them with axes."
</p>

<p>
Barely had Biorn sunk out of sight when
the pursuing party appeared, three-score
Saxons under two leaders.  "Pick off the
leaders, men," whispered Sigurd, and as
the party came between the two bands of
Norsemen, Biorn's horn sounded, and a
cloud of arrows poured into the compact
body of Saxons.  At the same time the
vikings seized their swords and axes and ran
forward.
</p>

<p>
The Saxons resisted bravely, but their
leaders had fallen at the first fire, and after
a minute of sharp hand-to-hand fighting
they broke and fled.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd had headed his men, engaging a
tall Saxon in single combat.  The other
wounded Sigurd badly in the shoulder at
the first exchange of blows; and, dropping
his shield, Sigurd grasped his great sword
in both hands and rushed his foe.  At the
first blow the other's shield-arm fell, numb
with the shock; at the second his sword flew
from his hand and he slipped on the ice,
falling heavily.
</p>

<p>
Seeing that the enemy had broken, Sigurd
paused and shouted:
</p>

<p>
"Back, men, back!  We only want to
give them a lesson, not to slaughter them!"
</p>

<p>
His own men obeyed, but Alfred's Saxons
drove on after the fugitives, and
Sigurd could hardly blame them.  Then he
turned to his foe; the man lay looking up,
awaiting the death stroke.
</p>

<p>
"Get up," exclaimed Sigurd with a
laugh, "I am no murderer!"
</p>

<p>
With an amazed expression, the Saxon
slowly got up, and then, seizing Sigurd's
hand in his, knelt and kissed it.  "Thanks,
lord," he said, "you are the first who ever
bested Wulf at the sword, and if you will
take him, he will serve you right well!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd smiled, but faintly; and Biorn
was just in time to catch him in his arms.
The wounded shoulder was streaming
with blood, and he had suddenly turned
faint.
</p>

<p>
While Biorn held him and the other men
crowded around, Wulf tore off his woolen
tunic and deftly bound up the wound,
Biorn watching him suspiciously; then,
taking Sigurd's feet while Biorn tenderly
held his body, the two carried him back
to the shore.
</p>

<p>
As they approached, Astrid ran up.
</p>

<p>
"Sigurd!  Is Sigurd hurt?"
</p>

<p>
"It is nothing," replied Biorn, "only a
wound in the shoulder.  He'll be all right
in ten minutes."
</p>

<p>
Wulf, who had wounded the boy, now
surprised Biorn by his tenderness.  Setting
the boy with his back to an ice-hummock,
he bathed his face with snow, and Sigurd
opened his eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Keep quiet," growled Biorn, as he
struggled to rise, "I will attend to the
embarking, and you can rest for a space."
</p>

<p>
By the time the water casks were aboard
Alfred and the Saxons had returned, and
the Saxon boy seemed genuinely sorry for
his rescuer's mishap.  All then embarked,
and Biorn divided the men between the
two ships.
</p>

<p>
On the "Crane" he took the Jomsvikings,
Olaf's courtmen, and a dozen
Saxons; the Norse prisoners and thirty
Saxons went on board the other ship.  In
an hour the sails were hoisted, and the
ships bore away from the land, heading east.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd sat on the forecastle of the
"Crane," Astrid and the two Saxons near
him.  "Now tell me your story," said
Sigurd, giving his own name and Astrid's.
</p>

<p>
"Our father was the Jarl of Mercia,"
began Alfred, "but King Ethelred has
always been jealous of his popularity, and
has persecuted him unceasingly.  Three
weeks since a party of armed men appeared
to seize our father, but he fled to a Danish
ship on the coast, and she took him off.
My elder brother Alfgar was taken and
blinded."
</p>

<p>
Astrid and Sigurd gave a cry of horror,
but Alfred smiled sadly.  "You do not
know of what Ethelred is capable, my
friends.  In his present condition Alfgar is
unfit to become Jarl, thus being as good as
dead in the King's opinion.
</p>

<p>
"My father had barely time to send a
man to warn us at Lincoln, and we fled
from home just in time to get to the fens
and escape.  Some fourscore men, all
devoted servants of my father, fled with us.
Twice Ethelred's men came upon us, and
we beat them off, but wounds and sickness
thinned my men, and these are all I have
left.  Last week Sigrid came down with
fever, and we had to fly again; but this
time, thanks to you, we are safe.  We will
never forget that we owe our lives to you,
Jarl Sigurd!"
</p>

<p>
Astrid immediately took charge of the
sick girl.  Thanks to his temperate life,
Sigurd's wound promised to heal rapidly,
and the man Wulf proved invaluable.  He
had been educated in a monastery, and was
skilled in leech-craft, and seemed devoted
to the boy Jarl.
</p>

<p>
"I thought to be killed at once," he told
Sigurd, who had summoned him.  "You
are the best swordsman, as well as the only
merciful viking, whom I ever met.  My life
is yours, Jarl, if so you will have it."  The
man's words were so sincere that Sigurd
accepted his offer gladly, for he was an
expert swordsman as well as leech, and could
both read and write, which was no small
accomplishment.
</p>

<p>
A council was now held on the
"Crane's" forecastle, to decide on what
course they should pursue.  They finally
came to the conclusion that they would run
south and cross to Flanders, where Alfred
and Sigrid would probably find their
father.  As soon as this course was fixed on,
Biorn took charge of the "Snake," as the
other vessel was named, transferring to
her that evening.
</p>

<p>
It proved well, indeed, that he did so, for
during the night a gale swept down out of
the northeast, and bore them helplessly
before it.  The Saxons on the "Snake," most
of whom had never been to sea before, were
of little use, and even Alfred was sick,
though Sigrid escaped; but there was nothing
to do save to keep the ships before the
wind.  It was bitterly cold, but as the
Norsemen did not mind this much, and the
girls were well wrapped up, no one suffered
greatly.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd had no fears for the two ships,
for both were new and rode the waves
easily.  The ships of the vikings could only
sail with a fair or a side wind, and as they
would be driven far past Flanders unless
the gale broke up soon, the four discussed
the situation that evening in the "Crane's"
cabin.
</p>

<p>
"We are certainly getting all the storms
we want," laughed Sigurd to Astrid, as he
came in and shook off the snow.  "Shall
we take the chances and head around for
the southern end of England?"
</p>

<p>
"No!" cried Alfred.  "Cannot we make
for Normandy?  There are many vikings
there, and it is settled by Norsemen."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd shook his head.  "Not unless the
wind shifts."
</p>

<p>
"I see," broke in Astrid, "that you are
thinking about getting me back home.  I
admit that I would like to see Vendland
again, but why don't you just take the
simplest course, Sigurd, run before the
wind, then around England and back to
King Olaf?"
</p>

<p>
"It sounds easy," laughed Sigurd, "and
that is what I would do if I were alone.
But with you and Sigrid on board I don't
like to take unnecessary risks."
</p>

<p>
Sigrid laughed as Alfred, in the throes
of seasickness, seized his cloak and left the
cabin.  "Don't mind us, Jarl; head for
Ireland by all means!"
</p>

<p>
"Well," responded Sigurd, "we'll see
how things look in the morning.  I'm going
to turn in now and get some sleep."
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap14"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XIV.
<br /><br />
IN BRETLAND.
</h3>

<p>
The morning broke dark and gloomy,
with no land in sight.  Sigurd,
concluding that they had been driven
below the Thames, if not below the end of
England, ordered the helmsman to steer
due west, and while he was unable to
communicate with the "Snake," he saw Biorn
follow his example at once, and knew that
he understood.
</p>

<p>
The gale had now lessened to a steady
wind from the northeast, interspersed with
flurries of snow, and both ships drove
steadily along under half-canvas.
</p>

<p>
For two days they held this course, and
then Sigurd held a shouted conference with
Biorn.  It seemed evident that they had
been carried south of England, so the prows
were turned north, and the next morning
land appeared.  Alfred had found his sea-legs
by this time, while Sigrid was rapidly
gaining strength and color from the salt
sea-air, which drove the marsh fever out
of her.  She was a very pretty girl, indeed,
with her blue eyes and long flaxen hair,
and she and Astrid were firm friends from
the start.
</p>

<p>
Wulf, who was now more a friend than
a captive, was a great favorite with all on
board, even with Alfred's Saxons.  On the
morning that land was sighted, he drew
Sigurd aside.
</p>

<p>
"Jarl, we must have fresh water at once.
Three of the casks were loosened by the
storm and have run out; there is only a
cask or two of ale left."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd made a wry face.  "Well, that
will keep us from thirst, and the men like
it well enough, though I have little taste
for it; but perhaps we can get water from
some river along the coast here, or from
the 'Snake.'"
</p>

<p>
Wulf disagreed.  "All Ethelred's Jarls
and Thanes will be looking for us, you may
be sure, and as soon as we are sighted the
housecarls will be poured down wherever
we land."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd thought it over, and finally
signaled the "Snake."  Biorn drew alongside,
but when Sigurd mentioned the shortness
of water, the old viking gave a cry of
dismay.
</p>

<p>
"Why, we thought to get some from
you!  Never mind, we are drawing into the
coast, and I will make a landing and find
out where we are.  We cannot be very far
from South Wales, and once there it will
be plain sailing, for the people there are of
my own race, and I have not forgotten the
language of the Cymry."
</p>

<p>
So they steered toward the shore, which
was high and rocky.  After coasting along
for two or three hours, a large bay was
revealed, half frozen over, with a hamlet
nestling on the cliffs above.
</p>

<p>
"They are fishing folk, most like," said
Alfred, "but there is no sign of a river
hereabouts.  We may have to melt up some
of that ice!"
</p>

<p>
Biorn's ship now drew carefully in, and
broke through the thin outer edge of ice.
When the "Snake" would go no farther,
Biorn leaped out after testing the ice with
oars, and a dozen men followed him to the
shore.  They found the hamlet in great
consternation, dreading the forays of the
pirates, but Biorn soon appeased their fears,
buying a goodly quantity of fish from them,
and returned to the ships.
</p>

<p>
The "Snake" drew alongside the
"Crane."  "No fresh water, Jarl,"
reported Biorn.  "Everything is frozen fast,
and these people melt ice for their needs.
They say there is a river half a mile
inland, but we dare not risk it."
</p>

<p>
"I would advise that if possible we bear
around South Wales and reach up for the
Northern Kingdom.  It will only be a day's
difference, and we won't find much help
among the people on this coast.  We might
take in some ice-cakes, in case the ale
gives out."
</p>

<p>
"How long does it take to reach North
Wales?" asked Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
"We ought to get there to-morrow night,
or the next day at latest," replied Biorn,
and Sigurd waved assent.  The ships
were rowed up to the ice and a supply of
this was taken on board each ship; then the
sails were hoisted, half the oars put out,
and at full speed they passed along the
coast, for Sigurd was determined not to
be caught in another tempest.
</p>

<p>
Next morning, however, the Land's End
was reached, and the prows turned north.
By nightfall the land was in sight ahead,
and early next morning they drew close
into shore.
</p>

<p>
"I know where we are," shouted Biorn
to Sigurd.  "Do you follow me, Jarl, and
we will speedily come to an open river,
unless I am greatly mistaken."
</p>

<p>
Before noon, indeed, a great shout of joy
went up from the men, for there before
them was a bay, with an open river flowing
down.  True, the channel was narrow and
dangerous for ships, for the ice nearly met
on either side; but the "Crane" followed
the "Snake" closely, and they entered the
channel.  Half a mile from the mouth this
widened out and turned suddenly; as the
"Snake" reached the bend Sigurd heard
Biorn's war-horn, and saw his men arming
themselves in haste.
</p>

<p>
"To arms, men!" he shouted, "and be
ready for whatever may befall!"  Alfred
quickly donned his armor and stood by
Sigurd in the prow.  As they in turn came
around the bend, they saw the reason for
Biorn's preparations; there before them lay
two large ships, moored for the winter on
shore, with a camp close by.  From their
appearance they were Danes, and high
above, on a neighboring knoll, could be
seen the roofs of a town of goodly size.
</p>

<p>
As the "Crane" came alongside the
"Snake," Sigurd saw that the vikings on
shore were also arming and assembling
around their two ships.
</p>

<p>
"This is the town of Neath, Jarl," cried
Biorn, as he leaped on board the "Crane,"
"and it was here that I was born.  What
ships these are I know not; shall we draw
in and hail them?"
</p>

<p>
"That would be best," replied Sigurd.
"Doubtless they are some vikings who are
wintering here, but it is strange, indeed,
that they are allowed to remain so near a
town, unless they came on a peaceful
errand."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd ordered the men to row as close
to shore as they could.  The ship stopped
two or three hundred yards from it, for
it was impossible to break through the ice,
and Sigurd blew a loud blast on a peace-horn.
In answer came one from the camp,
and a dozen men left the two ships and
started over the ice toward the "Crane."
</p>

<p>
As these came near, Astrid uttered a little
cry and caught Sigurd's arm.  "Oh, Fairhair,
look at that big man in front!  That
is Halfdan, the brother of Queen Gunhild,
and my own uncle!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd looked closely at the man,
remembered him well, for he had seen him
often while the Jornsborg men were at King
Svein's court.  Halfdan stopped just
beyond spear-cast of the "Crane."
</p>

<p>
"Who are you, and do you come in peace
or war?" he called.
</p>

<p>
"Good-morning!" laughed Sigurd, "don't
you know your friends, Jarl?"
</p>

<p>
The other started, looked keenly at the
ship, and ran forward.  "Surely, it is
Sigurd Fairhair!" he cried, as he came
near.  "And by the eye of Odin!  Am I
dreaming or is this Astrid?"
</p>

<p>
"Astrid it is, uncle!" laughed the girl,
jumping down on the ice and throwing her
arms around his neck.  The Jarl struggled
to disengage himself, and cried in mock
dismay:
</p>

<p>
"Help; help, are you trying to make me
captive?  Let loose!  Respect my dignity!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd followed Astrid to the ice, and
clasped Halfdan's hand.  "Be careful,
uncle," laughed Astrid, "Sigurd is your
equal in dignity now!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded at the surprised look of
the Dane.  "Yes, I am one of Olaf
Tryggveson's men now, Jarl, and he made
me a Jarl lately, although I am altogether
too young for such an honor."
</p>

<p>
"Nonsense, nonsense!" replied Halfdan,
his merry eyes gleaming with happiness,
"you are the handsomest Jarl I ever saw in
my life, upon my word!  But come up to
the camp."
</p>

<p>
"Wait," said Sigurd, turning to his
ships.  "Alfred, do you and Sigrid join
us.  Wulf, you and Biorn take charge of
the ships and lay them up on shore, there
beside the others.  We are with friends."
</p>

<p>
As Alfred and Sigrid climbed down to
the ice, the young Jarl presented them to
Halfdan, who greeted them heartily.
</p>

<p>
"I have heard of your father's misfortune,"
he exclaimed, "and I was sorry,
indeed, for I fought against him three or
four years ago, and he was a noble foeman.
However, he is safe in Flanders now, and
is like to return before long."
</p>

<p>
"Why, what do you mean?" cried Alfred,
in surprise.
</p>

<p>
"Come along to the camp and I'll tell
you."  Halfdan led the way to the shore.
"It's too cold to be standing out here talking."
</p>

<p>
As they entered the camp, the news
spread that a party of Jomsvikings were
among the arrivals, and a loud blast went
up from the horns, while the Danes met
them with shouts of joy, for the men of
Jomsborg were prime favorites with King
Svein's men.  Sigurd found several whom
he knew, while Astrid was met with fresh
cheers.  As they entered the large hut of
Halfdan, the Jarl drove the men off.
</p>

<p>
"Get out of here!" he cried.  "Go down
and help stow the ships up on land beside
ours.  We have much to talk over here, and
would be left in peace."
</p>

<p>
With a last cheer, the men vanished, and
Halfdan closed the door.
</p>

<p>
"Here is food and water, friends, if you
are hungry."
</p>

<p>
"We have plenty of food, but a drink
of water would not be amiss," answered
Sigurd.  "And now, how come you here,
in Wales?"
</p>

<p>
"First make yourselves comfortable."
Halfdan piled furs along the wall, for
Astrid and Sigrid, while he and the two
boys sat on the long wooden bench.  "Well,
of course you remember the oath that
Svein made that night?  He wasn't in such
a hurry as you Jomsvikings were, but he
has been making big preparations.  He sent
me here right after the news of Hiorunga
Bay arrived, for he had counted on your
men making a descent on Ethelred from
the west as well as from Northumbria,
where he himself will land in the spring
or summer.
</p>

<p>
"I arrived here a month or two ago, and
have arranged matters with Idwal ap
Meirig, the King of North Wales.  What
barbarous names these Welsh people have!"
</p>

<p>
"Probably they think ours just as bad,"
laughed Sigrid, "for they hate everything
Saxon; and as for your Norse names, I
am sure they used to sound harsh, even to us!"
</p>

<p>
"Well, in any case, King Idwal is up in
the town yonder, has agreed to join us, and
we see him nearly every day.  Now, tell
me something about yourself, Sigurd."
</p>

<p>
It was late when Sigurd finished his
tale, so Halfdan, who had given orders
meanwhile, showed the two girls to a hut
that had been hastily fitted up for them,
and shared his own with the boys for the
night.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap15"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XV.
<br /><br />
IN WINTER QUARTERS.
</h3>

<p>
Next morning Halfdan's men joined
forces with the new arrivals, and
got the two ships up on the shore,
dismantling and unloading them, while
parties of men hastened out to the
surrounding woods, and returned with great
quantities of firewood and timber, with
which fresh huts were built.
</p>

<p>
This was finished by evening, for Halfdan
had a hundred and fifty men, and many
hands made light labor.  For several days
the Norsemen rested quietly, for they had
many wounded, and some of the Saxons
were still down with fever.  Sigrid,
however, was now almost well, and the jovial
roughness of Halfdan amused her and
brought the roses back to her cheeks.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd and Alfred wished to visit the
town above, and if possible to take up their
quarters there, but Halfdan discouraged
them from doing so.
</p>

<p>
"King Idwal watches us sharp enough,
for he has suspicions of every Northman
within a hundred miles.  One cannot blame
him, either; the vikings have ravaged poor
Bretland terribly, destroying monasteries
and towns, and burning and plundering.
Your own man Biorn is a sample; he was
carried off in his youth.
</p>

<p>
"As for visiting the town, it is not
worth while.  There is nothing there save
a great castle and a cluster of dirty little
houses, and in any case Idwal has forbidden
our men to enter the town.  Once a
week the country folk come down here with
their market stuff, and Idwal sends us ale
by the cask.  Never fear, he will be down
pretty soon to see for himself who these
new vikings are."
</p>

<p>
For two weeks they remained in camp,
seeing nothing of the Welsh king, but all
were greatly interested in the people, who
brought fresh meat and food into camp
once a week.  Indeed, the vikings' camp
at these times assumed the appearance of
a fair, for most of the men made small
objects which the country people took in
exchange, and many merchants set up
permanent booths inside the camp.  The
Welsh people were smaller by far than the
Norsemen or Danes, and their bright,
quick eyes and black straight hair
contrasted strangely with the Northmen and
Saxons, most of whom were fair.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd and Alfred had at first feared
that the Saxons and Danes, hereditary
enemies, would not mingle well; but their
fears proved to be unfounded.  Halfdan
discovered from the country people that in
the forests to the west, only a few miles
distant, wolves were a terrible scourge; so
the men set to work and made skis for
themselves, and even Sigrid learned to use
the "snow-skates," as the Saxons called
the long wooden runners.  In the second
week of their stay the four young people
and Halfdan took a score of men, leaving
the camp in charge of Biorn, and for three
days went off on a wolf-hunt in the forest.
</p>

<p>
On their return Biorn told them that
word had arrived in their absence from
King Idwal, who intended to visit them on
the following day, with all his court.  Great
preparations were made for his reception.
Pine boughs were brought in from the
forest, with which the huts were decorated
gayly, and Halfdan's large hut was hung
with tapestries and cloths, which Sigurd
found in the cargo of the vessel which
Biorn had captured.
</p>

<p>
All the men rubbed up their armor and
weapons, and when in the morning the
Welsh were seen winding down the hill,
the force was drawn up in three divisions,
the Danes, Norsemen and Saxons grouping
themselves together under the standards
of Halfdan, Sigurd and Alfred.  Presently
the Welsh arrived in the valley leading to
the camp, and their coming was greeted by
a loud burst from the horns of the vikings.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-057"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-057.jpg" alt="&quot;They were greeted by a loud burst from the horns of the vikings.&quot;" />
<br />
&quot;<i>They were greeted by a loud burst <br />
from the horns of the vikings.</i>&quot;
</p>

<p>
Leading the way came a troop of
archers, behind whom, mounted on small
shaggy ponies, rode the King and his court.
Idwal was a larger man than most of his
followers, with keen black eyes and firm
features, shaved in the Danish fashion,
with two long mustaches.  As he came up
Halfdan advanced and greeted him.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, my lord King!  It gives us
pleasure to return the hospitality of your
castle!"
</p>

<p>
Idwal smiled.  "Truly, Jarl, I am glad
that these men of yours are not minded to
foray my borders!  We would have a hard
time of it to repel such a force as this.
I heard that you had been joined by a
fresh band of vikings, so came down to
assure myself that we were in no danger."
</p>

<p>
At this Halfdan motioned Sigurd and
his friends to advance and presented them
to the King.  The latter frowned as Alfred
came forward, and swept his eye over the
band of Saxons.
</p>

<p>
"It is many years since a Saxon has
dared seek hospitality from the Cymry, my
lad," he remarked.  Then Alfred told his
story, and the king's face cleared.
</p>

<p>
"Well, to be frank, I have small love
for Saxons, but since you are enemies of
Ethelred, that is another matter.  Tell me,
in case your father returned home and I
joined with King Svein, would you be for
or against me?"
</p>

<p>
He gazed keenly at Alfred, but the lad
met the look squarely, though with a smile.
"As to that, my lord King, I can only say
that I would fight for my own land against
the invader, whoever he was; yet if my
father thinks it right to join King Svein,
as well he may, I will be at his side."
</p>

<p>
Halfdan broke in with a laugh.  "Don't
be afraid, my lord, this Saxon will not have
to be feared for some time to come!  I dare
say that if you make a foray against Ethelred
this spring, he would stand as stoutly
at your side as any of your nobles.  But
come into the camp, my lord."
</p>

<p>
The vikings opened a path between their
ranks, and Idwal led his men through them.
In an open space amid the huts, Halfdan
had cleared away the snow and stretched
a large sail over a number of long tables,
while on either side blazed a dozen great
fires.
</p>

<p>
"By my faith," cried King Idwal, "this
is a right royal reception, Jarl!  An open
air banquet is far more to my liking than
one inside these huts, and these fires would
warm an army!"
</p>

<p>
So saying, the king tossed aside his fur
cloak, and Sigurd saw that he wore a light
suit of armor beneath it.  In the king's
train were some twoscore nobles, and a
bishop, to whom Halfdan accorded the
place of honor.  Among the Welsh,
bishops and priests were honored even above
the king, and they found Bishop Dafydd
a learned, kindly, and intensely religious
man, who was at once interested in Astrid
and Wulf, with both of whom he conversed
at great length.
</p>

<p>
It was well, indeed, that Halfdan had
been hunting for three days previously, for
his stock of venison was heavily drawn
upon.  Great fish were brought in, newly
taken from the river below, and to the
delight of the Welshmen a huge boar's head,
in the Saxon style, was placed before the
king.  The vikings spared no pains to make
the feast a notable one, and to Sigurd's
satisfaction the presence of Bishop Dafydd
and his men prevented it from becoming a
wild carouse, as the Norsemen were only
too apt to make it.
</p>

<p>
Before the King left that evening there
was an exchange of gifts, as was
customary.  Biorn and Jarl Halfdan, who
were skillful smiths, had the week before
made a beautiful byrnie, of woven gold
rings, and this was presented to the king,
who was delighted with it.
</p>

<p>
He presented Halfdan with a great
boar-hound, and to Sigurd he gave a cloak,
edged with fur, the scarlet cloth
embroidered in silver thread.  As he had been
informed of the presence of the two girls,
he had thoughtfully brought for them new
outfits of garments suited to their rank.
</p>

<p>
Idwal returned to his castle that evening,
and the bond between him and the vikings
was firmly cemented.  He assured Jarl
Halfdan that as soon as King Svein landed
in the east he would pour a flood of men
over the West Saxon earldoms, and
Halfdan had no doubt that the Danish king
would fulfill the oath he had sworn at his
accession feast.
</p>

<p>
After this the camp settled down for the
remainder of the winter.  Every week
hunting parties, on skis, brought in fresh
meat from the surrounding forests, while
their arms were repaired and added to by
the smiths.  The chiefs of the Northmen
were all trained armorers, and his work at
the forge added greatly to Sigurd's strength
and widened his shoulders immensely.
</p>

<p>
The two girls had a most enjoyable
time, for every man in the camp worshiped
them.  They joined the hunting parties,
and many a wolf fell before Astrid's bow,
while Sigrid, though less warlike, took
part with equal zest.
</p>

<p>
The time passed away rapidly, and in
March the snows melted and the four ships
were run out and overhauled.  They were
freshly pitched and calked, the masts were
stepped, and at last they lay at anchor,
fully ready for the sea.
</p>

<p>
King Idwal paid the camp a second visit,
after which the chiefs returned to the castle
with him for a few days.  He sent down
provisions of all kinds for the ships, and
at the beginning of April, Sigurd took
leave of Halfdan.
</p>

<p>
They gathered in the Jarl's hut on the
evening before sailing.
</p>

<p>
"Now, Jarl," said Sigurd, "I suppose
you will take Astrid home with you?"
</p>

<p>
"That depends," replied Halfdan,
quizzically, "upon whether she wants to go or
not!  She seems to like wandering about
the world, with a knight-errant to rescue
her and guard her from harm!"
</p>

<p>
Astrid blushed, and cried, "That's not
fair, uncle!  I'm going home with you&mdash;but
listen!  Why can't you come with us to
King Olaf, and go home by the north?
It is just as short that way, and far less
dangerous!"
</p>

<p>
The big Jarl leaped to his feet.  "Hurrah!
I never even thought of that; I
thought to go home around the south of
England, but in truth this way is as short,
and I would fain see this King Olaf, whom
you praise so highly."
</p>

<p>
It had been arranged that Halfdan was
not to sail till the next week, so he at once
dashed out and called his chiefs together.
Telling them of the new plan, the men
went to work, by torchlight, and finished
loading his two ships, and by morning all
was ready.
</p>

<p>
With a fair wind they reached out into
the bay, and three mornings later, after
coasting along the Irish shore, they came
in sight of the towers of Dublin.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap16"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVI.
<br /><br />
AN AMBUSCADE.
</h3>

<p>
Sigurd was received with unbounded
joy by King Olaf, for he had been
given up for lost in the storm that
swept the coast just before his departure.
Halfdan stayed in Dublin for a week, then
decided to return home without further delay.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd parted with Astrid sorrowfully,
for they had become very dear to each other
in their wanderings, and although Alfred
and Sigrid remained with him, he knew
that he would miss her greatly.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind," he said, as they walked
down to the ships, "we will land in
Norway this summer or fall, and be sure that
I will turn up at the Danish court, or in
Vendland, not long after."
</p>

<p>
"I'll be glad to see Vagn once more,
when I get home," said Astrid.  "It will
seem almost as good as seeing you."  Halfdan
had told them of Vagn's safe arrival
home, so that Jarl Eirik had evidently been
true to his word.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd and Alfred, in the "Crane,"
accompanied Halfdan's ships for a few miles;
then, with a last farewell to Astrid, the
"Crane" was turned about, and sought
Dublin again.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd's duties were light at the court.
Olaf's Irish kingdom was not divided in
districts, ruled by Jarls, as was Norway;
so that Sigurd had little to do beyond
commanding the courtmen.  Alfred had not
done homage to King Olaf, for he resolved
to remain true to his own land; nevertheless,
the King gave him a command, and
Alfred bore himself well indeed.
</p>

<p>
With the beginning of summer Olaf took
all his warships out of the water, scraped
the bottoms, and gave them a thorough
overhauling.  Thorir Klakke was still in
Dublin, and Sigurd found that he was
urging the King to sail as soon as might be
for Norway, saying that the bonders
would flock to him on his arrival, so that
he need not take so large a force.  King
Olaf, who thoroughly understood his treachery,
did not undeceive him; but to Sigurd
he said, one night after Thorir had left
the hall:
</p>

<p>
"Jarl, if ever a man deserved hanging,
there is one.  While you were absent in
England, two half-brothers of mine were
driven from Norway by Jarl Hakon, and
came to me here.  Thorir tried to bribe
them, and fortunately they let him think
that they fell in with his plans, which he
disclosed fully.
</p>

<p>
"Jarl Hakon, in truth, sent him here.
Thorir will try to slay me on the voyage,"
the King smiled grimly, "but if he fails, he
is to get me on shore at a certain point
where Hakon will keep men in waiting day
and night.  These men are to fall on me
and kill me."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd gave a cry of anger, and the
priest, Thangbrand, growled out, "Let me
attend to him, Olaf!  I'll warrant he does
not trouble you any more!"
</p>

<p>
Olaf laughed heartily.  "Thangbrand,
you are more fitted for a viking than for a
priest!  If I ever win Norway, I will send
you to Iceland to convert that island to
Christ."
</p>

<p>
The priest's face lit up.  "Thanks, my
King!  It is a shame that so fair an island
as that should have no church of Christ in
all its length!  It may be that I will meet
resistance there, but methinks I can hold
my own."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd laughed at this characteristic
speech.  Thangbrand was a strange mixture
of priest and warrior.  Driven from home
for his quarrelsome disposition, he had
joined himself to Olaf; but in reality the
man was deeply religious, and he was,
indeed, the ideal man to carry the Cross to
heathen Iceland.  In those days the Cross
and sword went together, and the old gods
of Norway knew many martyrs to their
faith before Christianity was established
in the land, in later years.  Right or
wrong, this was the spirit of the age, for
men overlooked the fact that Christ's gospel
was one of peace, and in their enthusiasm
and religious fervor they spread it with
fire and sword.
</p>

<p>
There was much irregular fighting
around Dublin, for the Irish kings were
ever striving to drive the Norsemen from
their land.  They fought bravely, but their
men were ill-armed compared with the vikings,
and Olaf had no trouble in preserving
order for many miles around the city.  His
brother-in-law, Olaf Kvaran, was away on
a trip to Iceland at this time.
</p>

<p>
"How would you like, Jarl," said Olaf
to Sigurd one evening, "to visit King Brian
Boroimhe?  I am minded to make peace
with him, for when I go to Norway I want
to leave Dublin in security, and my brother
is not to be relied on.  A firm peace with
King Brian for at least a year would be
an excellent thing."
</p>

<p>
"I would be glad, indeed," replied
Sigurd, "for I have heard so much about
the interior of Ireland that I would fain
see it."
</p>

<p>
"Well, I will have letters written in the
Irish tongue," said the King, "and do you
take what men you will, together with an
interpreter.  Be ready to start next
Monday, and I think you will find the King at
Kells, a large place some thirty miles to
the west.  However, I will provide a
reliable guide."
</p>

<p>
Thangbrand, the priest, hearing of the
embassy, eagerly sought leave to accompany
Sigurd, which Olaf willingly granted.
So, on the following Monday, Sigurd, the
priest, and a score of men left Dublin.
Their weapons were all in peace-bands, and
an Irish captive was taken as guide and
interpreter, having promised to lead them to
Kells in exchange for his liberty.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd laughed when Thangbrand joined
the party.  The huge priest wore a byrnie
under his gown, a light steel cap on his
head, and at his saddle-bow was shield and
sword.
</p>

<p>
"No one knows what may happen," he
replied stoutly, to the boy's peal of
laughter, "we may be waylaid by these Irish
thieves, or this guide may lead us astray,
and it is best to be prepared for anything."
</p>

<p>
Kells was only a good day's march away,
so they set forward briskly.  After reaching
the bounds of Olaf's territory the road
lay through woods and swamps for a dozen
miles; but toward evening they emerged on
an open plain, partly cultivated, and saw in
the distance the spires and towers of a large
city.  Several times they had been stopped
by bands of Irish, but their guide served
them faithfully.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd was amazed at sight of Kells.
"Why, this is wonderful!" he said.  "I
had no idea that there was such civilization
so near to Dublin!"
</p>

<p>
Thangbrand smiled.  "Kells has seldom
been ravaged by vikings, for many years; it
is a strong place, with a great monastery
in the town.  I have been here once before,
and found that the land is beautiful enough
in times of peace, but in war-time it would
be well-nigh impossible to reach the city."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd saw that this was so, as they
approached, for on either side of the road
were defenses, and several stone castles
came in sight.  Just at sunset they entered
the gates of the town, and their guide
spurred ahead to find quarters for the men.
</p>

<p>
As they passed through the streets they
met with sour looks and loud curses from
the Irish, who hated the Northmen bitterly,
with only too much reason.  The vikings
had ravaged the fairest vales of Erin, had
destroyed her monasteries and splendid
civilization, and but for the strong hand
of King Brian would have overrun the
country utterly.  That night they took
their quarters in a large inn, and the next
morning visited the court.
</p>

<p>
The King's palace was far beyond
anything Sigurd had ever seen, even in
London.  It was built of stone, and the great
hall within was a blaze of arms and
tapestries.  The nobles who thronged the hall
were clad much as were the Northmen,
but their golden bracelets and cloak-pins
were richly wrought, and the precious
metal seemed abundant.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd led his men to the high-seat, and
bowed low to King Brian, the famous
chieftain.  The latter was a powerful,
stern-faced man of some sixty years, and he
opened and read the letters of Olaf with a
frown, afterwards handing them to a monk
who stood at his side.
</p>

<p>
"Sir Jarl," he said, without rising,
fixing his gray eyes on Sigurd, "I will have
an answer written at once.  For the
present you and your men will be quartered
in my palace here.  King Olaf is a brave
and worthy man, and I am glad to conclude
a year's truce with him; were other
Northmen like him, Erin would be a happier
land."
</p>

<p>
The monk translated the King's words,
and bowing low, Sigurd retired.  Thangbrand
at once visited the monastery, taking
Sigurd with him; and although the good
monks were somewhat surprised at the
warlike appearance of the priest, they
entertained their visitors well, and showed
them over the buildings.
</p>

<p>
Next morning Sigurd had another
audience with King Brian, who handed him a
parchment for King Olaf, and presented
him with a heavy golden arm-ring; after
which the Norsemen left the city at once
on their return journey.
</p>

<p>
They rode along at a good pace, and as
they came near the boundaries of Olaf's
territory, Sigurd and Thangbrand rode
somewhat ahead of the party; for Thangbrand,
who was an adept at horsemanship,
of which the young Jarl knew little, was
showing Sigurd how to make his steed
curvet and prance, and thus they insensibly
drew ahead of the rest.
</p>

<p>
They turned a bend in the road, which
wound along beneath thick trees; and as
they did so a number of men sprang to
their horses' heads, and others sprang at
Sigurd and Thangbrand, striving to pull
them from their saddles.  At the same
instant, before they could grasp their
weapons, men dropped on them from the
branches overhead, and a minute later the
two Norsemen, bound hand and foot, were
being hurried away through the forest
depths.

<h3>
CHAPTER XVII.
<br /><br />
KETIL TURNS UP.
</h3>

<p>
Far behind them sounded a few faint
shouts and horns, as the men reached
the spot where the two leaders had
been ambushed; then these died away into
silence.  Sigurd saw that they were carried
by a band of two dozen Irish, who were
hastening north through the forest.  He
started to speak to the priest, who was
borne at his side, but one of the men struck
him roughly on the mouth, with a sharp
command in Irish, and he ceased.
</p>

<p>
At nightfall the band halted beside a
stream, and Sigurd judged they had traveled
several miles from the scene of their
capture.  A blazing fire was built, over
which the men cooked their meal, the two
captives being flung down beneath a large
tree.
</p>

<p>
"What fools we were to leave the
guide!" growled Thangbrand into his thick
black beard.  "I wish they would give us
somewhat to eat."
</p>

<p>
His wish was gratified immediately, for
the leader of the band approached, cut the
ropes that bound their hands, and gave
them bread and meat, and a horn of water
from the stream.  After this they were
bound again.
</p>

<p>
"They seem to be expecting someone,"
exclaimed Sigurd, "did you note that the
leader had sent men out in all directions?"
</p>

<p>
This had indeed been done as soon as
they arrived, and an hour later there was a
shout, and into the firelight came a second
body of men.  As they saw them, Sigurd
gave a cry of amazement, for at their head
was Ketil Gormson, whom he had left in
London the winter before!
</p>

<p>
The new arrivals were also Irish, Ketil
being the only foreigner.  The leader of
the first party greeted him, and Ketil put
into his hand a bag that clinked pleasantly.
Then he stepped forward to Sigurd's side.
</p>

<p>
"So I have you at last, my lord Jarl!"
he cried, an evil light in his dark eyes.
"It is a far cry from London to Ireland, but
I have watched and waited patiently."
</p>

<p>
"It is a pity that I didn't strike harder
that night!" replied Sigurd.  "What is
your object in this attack?"
</p>

<p>
Ketil laughed shortly.  "You go with me
to Jarl Hakon, my fine fellow, and as for
this follower of the white Christ, I think
I will turn him over to these good friends
of mine in the morning."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd turned pale, for he knew that any
Norsemen who fell into the hands of the
Irish obtained short shrift.  Thangbrand,
however, roared out:
</p>

<p>
"Loose my hands, you traitor, and face
me with drawn blade!"
</p>

<p>
"So," sneered Ketil, "I thought that
priests of your God were meek and humble
men, willing to die for their faith!"
</p>

<p>
Thangbrand flushed under the reproof,
and fell silent.  Ketil turned away, set a
guard over the captives, and in a few
minutes the band lay sleeping in their cloaks
beneath the trees.
</p>

<p>
The Norsemen's weapons had not been
taken from them, but as they were bound
firmly they were of no use.  Sigurd,
however, saw that the peace-bands had been
torn from his sword in the hasty flight
through the forest.
</p>

<p>
An hour after this he felt Thangbrand's
hands touch his.  The two captives lay
side by side, and their guard was sitting
a few feet away, nodding sleepily.  Turning
by inches, Sigurd looked at the priest,
and saw him motion toward the unbound
sword.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd, very slowly and cautiously,
rolled over on his face, bringing the
weapon within reach of Thangbrand, who
at the same time turned his back.  Thus
his hands, after a little vain searching,
met the hilt of the weapon and slowly
drew it forth.  An instant later their guard
straightened up and strolled over to them.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd lay on his face, and with a quick
movement Thangbrand had thrust the
drawn blade beneath him.  The guard,
thinking that both were asleep, turned
away, humming an air, and Sigurd caught
a faint rasping noise as the sword blade
cut through the priest's bonds.
</p>

<p>
Soon the guard returned, and stooped
over Sigurd, who lay nearer him, to assure
himself that his bonds were right.  As he
did so, Thangbrand drew him down to the
earth, his hands about the man's throat.
</p>

<p>
The struggle was brief and noiseless.  In
a few seconds the man relaxed, and the
priest quickly bound and gagged him; then
he cut Sigurd's bonds, whispering:
</p>

<p>
"If my hands were not so stiff I would
have done better."
</p>

<p>
Indeed, Sigurd found that his hands and
feet were too stiff to move, for he had
been tightly bound.  They both sat for a
moment rubbing their limbs, then arose.
</p>

<p>
"Which way, Jarl?"
</p>

<p>
"West, Thangbrand.  Once we strike
men belonging to King Brian we will be
all right, for his bracelet here will be
known, and you are a priest, too."
</p>

<p>
Without a word more they stepped away,
each picking up a light shield from beside
the sleeping men as they went.  The
forest was dark, but as the moon was just
rising Sigurd knew that their way would
soon be light enough to travel fast.
</p>

<p>
In half an hour they were well away
from the camp, and both broke into a swift
trot, threading their way among the trees,
and as far as they were able heading west.
The trees were roughly barked on the
north, and this guided them somewhat, for
both men were accustomed, at home in
Norway, to finding their way through the
forest by such signs.
</p>

<p>
"Hold up, lad," panted Thangbrand,
after an hour's running.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd slackened his pace, for the
ground was too uneven and rough to keep
it up longer, and for a time they walked
swiftly onward.
</p>

<p>
"Pray heaven that we strike no bog or
morass," said Thangbrand, "for if we do
we are lost."
</p>

<p>
"I wonder if we will be pursued?"
</p>

<p>
"If we are, I do not propose to fall into
their hands alive," answered the priest,
stoutly.  "They are evidently some
wandering band, who have been hired by that
villain Ketil.  I'd like to get him within
reach of my sword!"
</p>

<p>
They kept onward till dawn, walking and
running by turns.  As the gray light broke
through the trees, they found that the
forest was thinning out somewhat, and Thangbrand
flung himself down for a brief rest.
</p>

<p>
"I think we must be getting near the
cultivated fields in that broad plain we
crossed yesterday," conjectured Sigurd.
"If we can once get to Brian he will protect
us, for I have heard that no one could
be more jealous of his word than he."
</p>

<p>
Ten minutes later they continued their
way.  The sun was just rising now, and as
they stood on the top of a small hill,
vainly endeavoring to see some signs of
habitation, a faint yell arose from the forest
behind them.
</p>

<p>
"Come on, Thangbrand," exclaimed
Sigurd, breaking into a run.  "It is a
matter of speed now."
</p>

<p>
For half an hour they kept up a brisk
trot, but could hear the yells rising from
time to time behind them, each louder than
the last.  Finally Thangbrand stopped
short.
</p>

<p>
"Go on, Fairhair.  I am clean winded,
and your life is worth more than mine to
Olaf.  Do you go on, while I hold them
here as long as may be."
</p>

<p>
"One of the Jomsborg oaths," replied
Sigurd, quietly, "is to never desert a
comrade&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"Out upon your Jomsborg oaths!"
roared Thangbrand.  "Get you gone, and
lose no time!"
</p>

<p>
"Listen!" cried Sigurd quickly.  "Isn't
that a horn?"
</p>

<p>
Far off toward the west they heard the
faint notes of a war-horn, while from
behind them a loud shout arose, as their
pursuers came in sight.
</p>

<p>
"Hasten, Fairhair," cried the priest,
unsheathing his sword.  "Go yonder and
bring help while I hold them here!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd smiled and unsheathed his own
weapon, as he looked around.
</p>

<p>
"Cease this nonsense," he said, though
not without a thrill at thought of the
generosity of the big man.  "Let us stand
beneath this big oak, where we can swing
our swords without being struck in the
back."
</p>

<p>
They took position on either side of a
large oak tree, and five minutes later the
first of their pursuers appeared.  He halted
at seeing them, and sent up a yell; as his
comrades came up, they spread out, enclosing
the tree in a circle.
</p>

<p>
To do him justice, Ketil was brave
enough.  When he appeared, he led a dozen
men straight at the tree, and in a second
the two were fighting furiously.  The Irish
crowded around, striking with their long
knives, but speedily recoiled before the
terrible sweep of Thangbrand's huge sword,
and the more scientific, but no less deadly,
blows of the young Jarl.  As they retired,
their chief yelled an order, and the arrows
began to whizz past.
</p>

<p>
The first Sigurd caught with his shield,
the second he cut in two as it flew.  A
shout of amazement went up from the
Irish as Thangbrand did the same, for,
unacquainted as they were with the exercises
and training of the Norsemen, this skill
seemed little less than magical.  Again and
again the two men repeated the trick, but
it was impossible to ward off more than one
or two shafts at a time, and soon both
Thangbrand and Sigurd were wounded.
Suddenly Ketil sprang at Sigurd with a
shout of impatience.
</p>

<p>
The Irish circled around, watching the
combat with eager eyes, forgetful of all
else, while Thangbrand guarded Sigurd's
back.  Thrice Ketil's steel met that of
Sigurd, then seeing an opening, the latter
struck; but his feet slipped on the
dew-wet grass, and he fell headfirst.
</p>

<p>
Thangbrand was instantly bestriding his
body, facing Ketil.  At this the Irish came
in behind him, watching eagerly for a
chance to use their long knives, while the
priest crossed swords with Ketil.  Suddenly
the latter threw up his arms as something
flew past Thangbrand, and fell with a spear
through his body as a yell of terror went
up from his band.
</p>

<p>
Looking about as he raised Sigurd to his
feet, Thangbrand saw King Brian
Boroimhe behind him, sword in hand, while
his men pursued the fleeing band in all
directions, cutting them down without
mercy.
</p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XVIII.
<br /><br />
A MISSION FOR THE KING.
</h3>

<p>
The King addressed Thangbrand in
Latin, which the priest understood
fairly well.
</p>

<p>
"Just in time, my friends!  The guide
whom I sent with you returned late last
night with word of your mishap, and early
this morning I sent men in all directions,
joining myself in the search, for I was
greatly angered that my safe-conduct had
been broken in this wise."
</p>

<p>
"We owe you our lives, my lord," responded
Thangbrand gratefully.  "These
men were in the pay of a traitor, whom
your spear slew before I had a chance at
him, unfortunately."
</p>

<p>
The old king smiled, not unkindly.
"Strange words for a man of God, sir
priest!  But I see that your blade has done
good service to Jarl Sigurd, and perhaps
in these times a priest must be man of the
world as well."  King Brian sighed heavily
as he looked around, then said, "Ask the
Jarl if he has my letters safe."
</p>

<p>
When Thangbrand translated, Sigurd
held up the letters, their seals unbroken;
and now the King's men returned, and the
party went to Kells at once.  Here, as
Sigurd was in haste to get back to Dublin,
the King gave him an escort of fifty men,
and they set out without delay.
</p>

<p>
Upon reaching the territory of Olaf,
Sigurd dismissed the Irish and pushed
forward; but on coming within sight of the
city he gave an exclamation of dismay.
Instead of the King's standard, there
floated from the castle a huge black banner!
</p>

<p>
Wondering greatly, they galloped up to
the city and entered.  To their amazement,
the shops were all closed, and the whole
city wore an air of mourning.  Sigurd,
without stopping to ask questions, left
Thangbrand and hurried to the great hall.
</p>

<p>
It was empty, save for Olaf, who sat in
the high-seat, his head bowed in his hands.
Sigurd advanced and held out the letters.
</p>

<p>
"Here, my lord, is the reply of King
Brian Boroimhe.  Why is the black
standard on the castle, and why are all the
shops shut?"
</p>

<p>
Olaf raised his head and gazed at Sigurd
with heavy eyes.
</p>

<p>
"Welcome back, Jarl, in an evil hour.
Queen Gyda died last night."
</p>

<p>
As Sigurd stared at the King, the latter
rose slowly, descended from the high-seat,
and taking Sigurd's arm in his, exclaimed:
</p>

<p>
"Sigurd, come and talk to me.  I am
lonely, and the most wretched of all men."
</p>

<p>
They walked up and down the hall, and
Olaf told Sigurd how the night before the
Queen had been seized with a fatal illness.
Good Bishop Sigurd, the English prelate
who had come to Ireland with Olaf, had
done his best, for he was a skillful leech,
but to no avail.
</p>

<p>
"Why should this evil come upon me
now?" cried the King, bitterly.  Sigurd
said little, allowing the King's pent-up
grief to find utterance, then he said, softly:
</p>

<p>
"It is the will of God, Olaf, and perhaps
he has done it for the best.  May it
not be that he means you to give your
whole life to the spreading of his Word in
heathen Norway, and has sent you a touch
of adversity to try you?"
</p>

<p>
"Mayhap," responded the King, "but it
is hard.  He has given me good fortune,
and I must bear the bad when it is his
will; it may be true that he wishes me to
devote myself, heart and soul, to bearing
his gospel to my countrymen."
</p>

<p>
The blow was a terrible one to Olaf, and
it was indeed many a month ere he recovered
a portion of his former light-hearted
spirits.  Two days later the Queen
was buried, and after the period of mourning
Olaf threw himself into the work of
preparing the expedition with feverish
energy.
</p>

<p>
This was no light task, indeed.  Olaf
had a dozen warships in the harbor, but it
was impossible to take so large a force, as
men had to be left to defend Dublin.  Olaf
had decided to give up his Irish land, in
case of succeeding in Norway, to his
brother-in-law, Olaf Kvaran, but he could
not leave him without men.
</p>

<p>
At last, after many consultations with
Sigurd and his other chiefs, the King
decided to take only the five largest ships,
which would hold about seventy-five men
each.  Thorir Klakke had no inkling that
Olaf knew of his treachery, and he advised
the King to make a sudden descent on
Norway and to take Jarl Hakon unawares at
Thrandheim, before men could be gathered.
Thorir, in giving this advice, thought that
either he would be able to kill Olaf by
treachery on the voyage, or else that the
men of Hakon, posted at Agdaness in
Norway, would remove Olaf before the plan
could be accomplished.
</p>

<p>
The five ships were fitted up in the best
of shape.  The dragon heads were taken
from their prows, and in the place of these
great crosses were set up, for Olaf knew
that only by the favor of God would he be
able to win his father's kingdom.  They
were laden with all the wealth that Olaf
had gathered in his travels through Russia,
Constantinople, and England, and at
length the expedition was ready to start.
</p>

<p>
It was a bright morning in August that
the King went on board his ships, followed
by all his men.  Before doing so, he called
Alfred and Sigrid to him, and asked them
what they intended to do.  Alfred
hesitated, for although he wished to
accompany Olaf, he did not forget that his
father was in Flanders, and he did not
like to separate from his sister.  Finally,
Olaf said, with a smile:
</p>

<p>
"You both had best come with me.  I
have a plan which I think will work out
to your satisfaction; I will tell you later
just what it is.  Put all your Saxons on
board the 'Snake,' Alfred&mdash;the ship that
old Biorn captured in England, and sail
with us.  Sigurd will command the
'Crane,' and when we get to the Orkneys I
will tell you what I have in mind."
</p>

<p>
So, wondering what the King meant, the
"Snake" was added to the fleet, to
Sigurd's great joy.  He had feared that
Alfred and his sister would be left behind,
and it was with no small satisfaction that
he helped fit out the "Snake."
</p>

<p>
When the men were all embarked,
Bishop Sigurd, standing in the prow of
King Olaf's ship, offered up a solemn
prayer asking the aid and the blessing of
God for their enterprise.  As he concluded,
a great "Amen!" rolled over the sea from
ships to shore, the anchors were weighed,
and the journey was begun amid a blare of
war-horns and the clash of arms.
</p>

<p>
The Pentland Firth was not passable,
according to reports brought to Olaf, so he
bore up for the Orkneys, as had been his
wish from the first.  These islands had
long been settled by Norsemen, and Jarl
Sigurd Lodvarson ruled them: but the Jarl
and his people were all heathen, for no
missionaries or Christian men had been
allowed to settle in the islands.  It was
Olaf's firm intention to spread the Word of
God wherever he went, and as the Orkneys
were in his path, he decided to visit Jarl
Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
This was a dangerous proceeding, for
the Jarl was powerful, and might have
settled the fate of the expedition there and
then; but matters came out luckily for
Olaf.  His six ships came to anchor in
Asmundar Bay, in Rognwald Island, and
in the bay they found a single ship lying at
anchor.
</p>

<p>
Olaf, seeing that the ship was a fine one,
and very beautifully furnished, dispatched
Sigurd Fairhair to bring her commander
on board his own ship, hoping to get news
of Norway.  To his surprise, it happened
that this commander was no other than
Jarl Sigurd Lodvarson himself!
</p>

<p>
Olaf greeted him with a smile.  "Truly,
it seems that we have an abundance of
Sigurds here!  Yourself, my own Jarl
Sigurd Fairhair, good Bishop Sigurd, of
England, and possibly a score of my men,
all named alike."
</p>

<p>
The Jarl, not knowing where King Olaf
was bound with his fleet, was somewhat
fearful for his safety, and when Olaf urged
him to be baptized, he refused, saying the
faith of his fathers was good enough for
him.  Then King Olaf arose, holding in one
hand a sword, in the other a cross.
</p>

<p>
"Jarl, you hold, as Jarl of the Orkneys,
part of my inheritance, for I claim all the
lands as mine which the Kings of Norway
have possessed.  As it has come to pass,
by the will of God, that you are in my
power, there are two courses open to you.
The one, that you accept the true faith,
and allow yourself to be baptized, with all
your subjects.  You may expect to hold
under me the Jarldom which you now
possess, and what is of more importance,
you may hope to reign for ever in a
nobler kingdom than this.
</p>

<p>
"The other course, a very wretched one,
is that you die; and after your death I
will pass over the islands and bring the
folk to believe in the true God.  Now
choose, Jarl, which course you will take."
</p>

<p>
The Jarl hesitated; then he slowly
stretched out his hand and took the cross
from that of Olaf.  This action was greeted
with glad shouts from the crews, and without
delay Bishop Sigurd baptized Jarl
Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
Then he swore oaths of fidelity to King
Olaf, and placed in the King's hands his
son, Hundi, who was also baptized, and
who accompanied Olaf to Norway as a
hostage.
</p>

<p>
Next day Olaf came on board the "Crane."
</p>

<p>
"Sigurd," he said, "are you willing to
undertake another mission for me?  You
seem to scrape through somehow, no matter
what happens, and as this one is of some
importance I can think of no one better
fitted to undertake it."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd smiled.  "If I have scraped
through some tight places, Olaf, I don't
ascribe it to my own conduct!  I have been
fortunate in finding friends, and for the
rest, God has protected me.  Now tell me
what this mission is."

<h3>
CHAPTER XIX.
<br /><br />
AT KING SVEIN'S COURT.
</h3>

<p>
Astrid and Halfdan had a safe and
quiet voyage home to Denmark, but
when they arrived there they found
that many changes had taken place during
the winter.  The pale, quiet, religious
Queen Gunhild had died, and as she alone
had restrained King Svein from his wild
and warlike impulses, the King was gathering
great forces for his descent on England.
</p>

<p>
Astrid took up her abode in the castle
as formerly, but the life was a lonely one.
Her parents had died when she was a
child, and only her Uncle Halfdan was near
her.  She disliked King Svein, who,
although he always treated her well and
kindly, was a moody and irritable man,
with no thought for anything save his
selfish ambitions.  Soon after Astrid's
return he placed in her care his two sons,
Harald and Canute, and she took great
interest in the education and care of the two
lonely boys, little thinking that in after
days the younger was to prove a great and
worthy king of England, thanks to her
early teachings.
</p>

<p>
So the summer passed, while men
assembled and were sent on to the Danish
settlements in the north of England to wait
the arrival of Svein in the fall.  Jarl
Halfdan was sent in command of one of these
detachments, and after his departure Astrid
felt her loneliness more than ever.
</p>

<p>
One day King Svein sent for her.
Wondering at the summons, Astrid proceeded
to the hall, where she found the
king surrounded by his chiefs.
</p>

<p>
"Lady Astrid," he said abruptly,
"prepare your belongings for a journey.
Your hand has been asked in marriage
by the son of King Vladimir of Russia, and
needless to say, I have accepted the offer,
for besides being a great honor, this will
bring to my army a number of ships from
Russia."
</p>

<p>
Astrid was overwhelmed, but answered
the King bravely.  "You have no right to
dispose of my hand, King Svein, in this
fashion!  It is unjust to me, for I am not
your vassal.  My lands lie in Vendland,
and if necessary I shall appeal to King
Burislaf for protection against this outrage!"
</p>

<p>
The King's face darkened.  "You will
do as I order!" he exclaimed angrily.
"King Burislaf also will do whatever I
order him, and this is a thing unheard of,
that a girl should decide her own marriage!"
</p>

<p>
A murmur of assent went up from the
chiefs, and Astrid gazed hopelessly around
the circle of fierce faces, finding no hope in
them.  How she longed for her good uncle
to stand at her side!  But as the King said,
a girl in those days could rarely indeed
marry whom she liked; her parents or
guardian settled that without consulting
her, and Astrid felt that she was helpless.
"This is a noble marriage," continued
the King, more calmly, "so let me hear no
more of these protests.  You will leave
here in two weeks for Gardarike, Vladimir's
capital, with a fitting escort."
</p>

<p>
With that the girl was dismissed to her
apartments.  Young Canute, hearing of
the matter, tried to comfort her, but the
boy was of course as helpless as she.  So,
although Astrid resolved that the marriage
should never take place, even though she
had to fly from home, the packing of her
effects proceeded.
</p>

<p>
A week later, as she was sitting sewing
in the garden, she heard a great noise
from the harbor, shouts and war-horns
mingling with the clash of arms.  She
sent Canute to see what it was about, and
presently the boy came running back, his
eyes bright and his cheeks flushed with
excitement.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, Astrid!" he cried, "we have visitors!
Two great ships just sailed into the
harbor, from far over the sea&mdash;the strangest
ships!  They didn't have any dragon
in the bow, but instead was a big gilded
cross!  All the men on board had shields
with red crosses on them, and I saw them
as they landed&mdash;great warriors, all of
of them!"
</p>

<p>
Astrid's cheek paled suddenly.  What
ships could these be, sailing under the
Cross, unless&mdash;?  Canute continued hastily:
"And, Astrid, you ought to see the
chiefs!  There is one old viking, so fierce
and brave-looking, and a beautiful girl
with bright yellow hair, and a boy who
must be her brother; but greatest of all
was a young man with hair like sunlight,
streaming over his shoulders, and a great
golden helmet&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Astrid did not wait to hear the rest.
Dropping her work, she ran to her rooms,
her heart beating wildly.  Swiftly calling
her women, she attired herself, and
descended to the hall, which was empty.  She
hastened out, and leaving the castle, went
down to the harbor.
</p>

<p>
There all the townfolk and the men
from the castle were crowded about the
market place, and as they made way for her
respectfully, Astrid saw King Svein talking
to a number of people, whom she could
not see for the crowd.  As she made her
way through the press, a well-known voice
fell on her ear; and then, with flushed
cheek, she found herself face to face with
Sigurd Fairhair!
</p>

<br />
<i>She found herself face to face with Sigurd Fairhair.</i>
</p>

<p>
He gave a cry of delight as he saw her,
and gripped her hands until they hurt.
</p>

<p>
"Astrid!"
</p>

<p>
"Why, Sigurd!" she replied, noting how
he had grown, "what a big man you have
become already!  Oh, how glad I am to see
you&mdash;and how I need you, too!" she added
in a lower tone.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd gave her a quick, anxious look,
then turned.  "Here, Alfred, Sigrid!" he
shouted, and the next minute the two girls
were in each other's arms, while the crowd
looked on, amazed.  Sigurd told King Svein
something of their tale, then the king
ordered all to follow him to the castle.
</p>

<p>
"We can talk in peace there," he said.
"Do you come up at once.  My men will
attend to your ships, so bring your warriors
ashore and let them be entertained at the
barracks."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd left this to Biorn, and the four
young people followed Svein to the castle,
where they seated themselves in the hall,
below the high-seat.
</p>

<p>
"Now, how do you come to be here, of
all places?" asked King Svein, who
remembered Sigurd well.  In return Sigurd
told him about the rescue of Alfred and
Sigrid.  Svein nodded.
</p>

<p>
"I know the story.  Jarl Alfwic is even
now with my army in England.  Go on."
</p>

<p>
"King Olaf," continued Sigurd, "sent
Alfred and his sister to you asking that
you take them with you to their father;
or, if you could not do this, to see that they
received a pilot to take them safely to
Flanders.  However, since you are going
to England before long yourself, that is
settled."
</p>

<p>
"Right glad will I be," replied the King,
"to have the son of Jarl Alfwic with me.
They will be safely delivered to the Jarl,
have no fear."
</p>

<p>
"As to myself," said Sigurd, "that is
another matter.  King Olaf has sailed for
Norway to take the kingdom from Jarl
Hakon, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
He was interrupted by a cry of amazement
from the Danes.
</p>

<p>
"What say you?" shouted Svein, leaping
up, "King Olaf has sailed for Norway?
Skoal!  Skoal!" The chiefs roundabout
echoed the cheer.
</p>

<p>
"He sent me to you, King Svein, to ask
that if possible you will send him ships
and men; or, if you cannot do this, that at
least you will not aid Jarl Hakon and Jarl
Eirik."
</p>

<p>
"As to the first request, I cannot do
that," replied Svein, "for I need every
man I can raise.  Be sure, however, that
Olaf need fear no attack from me; I will be
joyful, indeed, when the traitor Hakon is
driven from Norway!"
</p>

<p>
"That will be good news for Olaf,"
rejoined Sigurd, "for an attack in the rear
would be fatal.  He has but five ships, of
which mine is one, and his success will
depend entirely on his being able to surprise
Hakon."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd then told of how Olaf had
Christianized the Orkneys, and how he had
dispatched him immediately on this journey.
Olaf was to remain three weeks in the
islands, baptizing the people, and had
arranged to meet Sigurd at Moster, an
island on the west coast of Norway, for
which Olaf would direct his course.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd had no opportunity to speak with
Astrid till the evening, and he was puzzled
by her words of that morning.  Not till
Alfred, Sigrid and he went to her apartments
in the evening did he receive an
explanation.  Then Astrid told them about
Svein's plans for her marriage.
</p>

<p>
"It is a shame!" exclaimed Sigrid.
"Why, in England a girl must yield obedience
to her father's wishes, but she is not
forced into marrying in this way!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd was silent, his brows knitted.  "I
am in a bad position," he said at last.  "Of
course, the simplest way out of it would be
for you to come on board the 'Crane,' and
for us to join King Olaf; but I am on a
mission here that I must not neglect.  I
cannot anger Svein against Olaf, as such
an action would do; not that I care for my
own sake, but it might mean ruin to my
King."
</p>

<p>
Alfred agreed with him.  "Yes, you
must consider your duty to Olaf; and yet
there are two sides to it&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"No," broke in Sigurd, "there are not.
At any cost must Svein's finger be kept out
of Olaf's pie, for Svein is liable to abandon
his English trip and turn all his forces
against Norway in a sudden fit of rage.
That would be fatal to Olaf at present."
</p>

<p>
"I think I have a plan," remarked Sigrid
after a moment.  "As long as you do not
appear in Astrid's escape, it will be all
right, won't it?"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd nodded.
</p>

<p>
"Well then, give Wulf a few men and
that cutter that is on the 'Snake,' let them
take Astrid on board, and wait for you at
some place along the coast.  You must
leave to-morrow or next day to rejoin Olaf,
so you can pick them up as you go, and
King Svein will think Astrid has fled of her
own will."
</p>

<p>
"Good!" cried Sigurd.  "What say you
to the plan, Astrid?"
</p>

<p>
"I think it is a good one, too," replied
the girl, her dark eyes sparkling, "but all
my things are packed up, and I don't want
to meet King Olaf looking like this!"
</p>

<p>
She blushed as a peal of laughter went
up from the rest.
</p>

<p>
"Never mind, Astrid," laughed Sigrid,
"I will put a chest aboard the 'Crane'
to-night; my things will fit you pretty well,
and King Olaf gave me a whole shipload
of dresses."
</p>

<p>
"Better put it in the cutter," said Alfred,
"for when Svein finds his ward gone, he
will search our ships first thing."
</p>

<p>
So it was arranged, that the next night
Wulf, who had firmly attached himself to
the young Jarl, should wait at the dock for
Astrid, who insisted on making her way
down to the harbor alone.

CHAPTER XX.
<br /><br />
THE KING AND THE TOWEL.
</h3>

<p>
Next morning Wulf was instructed in
his part.  He had become firmly
attached to the young Jarl, and was
eager for the business; he and Biorn had
proved wise advisors on many occasions.
</p>

<p>
In the afternoon Sigurd and Alfred went
hunting with King Svein, and the party did
not return till long after nightfall.  When
they reached the castle they found the
courtyard ablaze with torches.
</p>

<p>
"What is this?  What means this
commotion?" roared the King, dismounting
hastily and striding forward.
</p>

<p>
Ulf, the gray-headed old seneschal, met
him.  "The Lady Astrid of Vendland has
disappeared, my lord, and we can find no
trace of her in all the castle and town!"
</p>

<p>
For a moment the King's rage was terrible,
and he turned on Sigurd, his face
working in fury.
</p>

<p>
"This is your doing, Jarl!  You have
accepted my hospitality, traitor, and&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
"You forget yourself, my lord," interrupted
Sigurd calmly.  "I have been with
you all day, and could have known nothing
of this matter.  I do not blame the girl
greatly, yet you can account for my actions."
</p>

<p>
"True," replied Svein, his anger cooling
under Sigurd's reply, "I beg your pardon,
Jarl, for my haste.  Will you allow my
men to search your ships?  It may be that
the girl has fled on board one of them,
seeking shelter with the Lady Sigrid."
</p>

<p>
"Willingly, King," answered Sigurd,
Alfred joining with him.
</p>

<p>
The King at once sent men in all
directions, mounted and on foot; but when
Sigurd retired for the night nothing had
been found of Astrid.
</p>

<p>
In the morning Sigurd took leave of King
Svein, who, preoccupied with the flight of
Astrid, offered no hindrance to his
departure, presenting him with many gifts,
indeed, which Sigurd returned in kind.
</p>

<p>
His departure was the occasion for a
much more sincere and affectionate
farewell between himself and the young
Saxons.  Alfred and Sigrid stood on the deck
of the "Crane" till the last moment, and
their eyes were moist as they said good-by.
</p>

<p>
"Be sure to visit us in England next
year," were Alfred's parting words.  "We
will look for you in the summer at Lincoln!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd promised to come if possible, and
so the three friends parted.  As the "Crane"
sailed from the harbor Sigurd's last view
was of Sigrid, standing on the forecastle
of the "Snake" and waving her scarf in
farewell.
</p>

<p>
"Where are we to pick up Wulf and
Astrid?" Sigurd asked Biorn, after they
had left the land behind.
</p>

<p>
"About twenty miles north, Jarl.  I sent
a man with him who knew of a small
river mouth where they can lie hid
without danger."
</p>

<p>
Shortly after noon Biorn, taking the
helm, steered the "Crane" carefully in to
the land, skirting along the shore, and in
half an hour the cutter darted out as they
passed.
</p>

<p>
"Hurrah!" shouted Sigurd, as Astrid
climbed up the side.  "You have done well,
indeed, Wulf!  King Svein was completely
at sea as to where his ward had gone!"
</p>

<p>
"And now for King Olaf!" cried Astrid
merrily, as Wulf carried Sigrid's chest into
the cabin and she disappeared.
</p>

<p>
It was many days before they saw the
King, however, for Moster was far up the
Norwegian coast.  They made the high
cliffs of Agdir first, and sailed north along
the coast; on the way they passed by
Hiorunga Bay, but did not enter, for the
place recalled sad thoughts to Sigurd's
mind.
</p>

<p>
"Have you seen Vagn?" he asked Astrid,
as they watched the Herey Islands speed
by.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, yes!" she exclaimed.  "How could
we have forgotten to speak of him before!
He came to see me last spring&mdash;and just
think, Sigurd!  He is married!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd gave an exclamation of surprise,
and Astrid continued.
</p>

<p>
"Yes, he married a girl in Norway, and
brought her back to Denmark.  He would
have nothing to do with Jarl Sigvald on
his return, calling him a coward and a
traitor, and the Jarl is remaining close in
Jomsborg.  Vagn himself is in the south of
Denmark, where his father owned some castles."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd was surprised to hear that his
cousin was married, and he firmly resolved
to visit him as soon as the result of Olaf's
expedition was decided.  The next morning
they arrived at Moster, and before the
fishing village found the four ships of Olaf,
which had arrived a few days previously.
</p>

<p>
Olaf welcomed Astrid back with much
merriment.  "You seem to come back to
your friend Oli," he laughed, "and this time
Oli is not going to let you go away so
soon!"
</p>

<p>
Sigurd told him the story of Astrid's
flight, and the King commended his Jarl
for acting so wisely.  "If Svein had come
on us now, Fairhair, it would have been all
over with us; as it is, you did right in
getting the maid away without trouble, and I
am heartily glad that you did so."
</p>

<p>
Olaf stopped at Moster for two days, and
as he had first landed in Norway there,
he marked out a space on the ground, gave
Thangbrand plenty of money and materials,
and left him there to build the first church
in the country.
</p>

<p>
After this Olaf sailed north day and
night as the wind favored him, following
the land, but keeping to the open sea,
outside the islands which were strewn thickly
along the coast.  When the wind was contrary
he anchored at the islands farthest out
to sea, and did not touch the mainland, for
fear that Jarl Hakon would receive news
of his coming.  At last, just at evening,
they reached Agdaness, at the entrance to
the Firth of Thrandheim.
</p>

<p>
After the ships were anchored and the
awnings raised, King Olaf visited the "Crane."
</p>

<p>
"Now, Sigurd," said he, "I wish your
advice.  Thorir Klakke is on board my ship,
and you know how his plans were revealed
to me by my brothers, whom he attempted
to bribe.  Well, Jarl Hakon's men are hidden
in the forest yonder, and are doubtless
awaiting us; Thorir is to take me ashore
alone, as if to arrange some plan of action,
and there I am to be killed.  Now, what
would you suggest doing?"
</p>

<p>
Thinking it over, Sigurd replied, "It
seems to me, Olaf, as that it would be fitting
to let the traitor fall into his own trap.
Put a score of men ashore to-night, let them
hide near by, and when Hakon's men appear
let our men charge them and put them to
flight, after which Thorir should be executed."
</p>

<p>
"That is a right good scheme."  answered
the King.  "I do not want to take life, God
knows, yet such criminals must be punished;
and the most fitting punishment for
this man is death.  So be it."
</p>

<p>
Early the next morning Sigurd, watching
from the "Crane," saw Thorir and the King
go ashore alone.  They walked along the
shore, then Thorir held up his glove, as if
signaling.  The next minute a number of
men broke from the trees, but as they did
so, more men rose up from among the
bowlders on the shore and put them to
flight.  Two of these latter fell on Thorir,
while the King watched, and the unfortunate
man expiated his treachery with his life.
</p>

<p>
After this, Olaf, walking down to the
water, shouted to Sigurd to come ashore,
which the young Jarl did.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Fairhair, let us walk up and see
if we can find a farm, where we can learn
tidings of Jarl Hakon.  If he is in Thrandheim
we must fall upon him to-day or to-morrow
at latest, for these men will bear the
news of our coming."
</p>

<p>
They walked up the hill, leaving their
men behind, and presently came to a little
farmhouse, with a pasture behind it where
some cows were grazing.  Walking up to
the door, they saw an old woman inside,
and Olaf addressed her.
</p>

<p>
"Good dame, may we have a drink of
fresh milk?  We are two travelers, and
will pay for what we take."
</p>

<p>
"Welcome, friends!" replied the woman.
"Enter and I will get some milk and bread."
</p>

<p>
While she was away, Olaf and Sigurd
washed their hands at the well beside the
house, and entering again, the King took
up a towel that was lying on the table, and
dried his hands on it.  At that moment the
woman returned, and snatched the towel
from his hand.
</p>

<p>
"It is easy to see that you have not
been brought up very well, and have been
taught little good," she cried angrily.
"Know you not that it is wasteful to wet
all the towel at once?"
</p>

<p>
Olaf responded, soberly, "Well, well,
mayhap I shall still rise in the world so
high that I may dry my hands in the
middle of the towel!" Sigurd was bursting
with laughter, and at this reply he could
hold in no longer, and the woman looked
furiously at him.
</p>

<p>
They drank their milk, and the coin that
Olaf handed the woman somewhat appeased
her.  "Tell me," he asked, "do you
know where Jarl Hakon is?"
</p>

<p>
"Last night he was in hiding, my son
told me."
</p>

<p>
"In hiding!  What mean you?" exclaimed
the King.
</p>

<p>
"Why, whence come you that you know
not?  Within the last few months Hakon
has become so cruel and tyrannical that
there is no living with him; two days ago
his exactions in Gauladale caused the
bonders to rise against him, under Orm Lugg.
They separated the Jarl from his ships and
drove him into the forest, no one knows
where.  My son told me last night, ere he
crossed the Firth to join the bonders, that
they were going to look for him at the
home of Thora of Rimul, a great lady who
is a relative of the Jarls."
</p>

<p>
"Well, well!" said the King, as they
hastily returned to the ships.  "Think you
not that heaven is with me, Fairhair?
Here I come to Norway at the very
moment when Hakon has goaded the bonders
to rise in revolt; I find him cut off from
his men and ships, driven a fugitive into
the forests, mayhap slain by this time!
Come, let us make all haste to cross the
Firth and arrive at Gauladale."
</p>

<p>
So, hastily shouting out the news to the
other ships as they went on board, the
prows were turned across the Firth of
Thrandheim, toward the district of Gauladale.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap21"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXI.
<br /><br />
THE DEATH OF HAKON.
</h3>

<p>
As they left the shelter of the bay
and drew across the Firth, the
narrow entrance of which was only
two or three miles in width, three ships
were seen sailing along the opposite shore.
Olaf steered directly for them, for
without doubt these were ships of Hakon's;
but as the fleets neared each other, the
three ships, evidently taking Olaf's ships
for foes, turned toward the shore.
</p>

<p>
The King dashed forward, coming up
with the three ships just as they ran up
on a sandbar.  Their crews leaped
overboard, wading and swimming to shore, and
directly in front of Olaf's ship was seen
a large, handsome man, swimming.  Olaf
shouted, but he paid no heed; so, seizing
the tiller, the King flung it at him.  The
heavy missile struck him on the head, and
he sank.
</p>

<p>
Then Olaf's men, leaping overboard,
pursued the flying men, slaying some and
capturing others.  As soon as the captives
were brought on board the King interrogated them.
</p>

<p>
It seemed that the man whom Olaf had
slain with the tiller was Erland, a son of
Jarl Hakon, and that these ships were
going to the Jarl's aid.  Further, the
prisoners said that Jarl Hakon's forces
were utterly dispersed, that the bonders
were in revolt throughout the whole
district, and that none knew where the Jarl
was in hiding.
</p>

<p>
King Olaf at once landed some of his
men with orders to tell everyone who he
was, why he had come, and to bid all the
bonders meet him the next day in Gauladale.
Then the five ships were steered
east, going up the Firth, and that
afternoon the King was landed at Gauladale.
</p>

<p>
He found a great meeting of the chief
bonders and leaders of the revolt against
Hakon in progress, and as soon as these
found who he was, they greeted him with
tears of joy, and welcomed him most
heartily.  Olaf brought his chiefs, Sigurd
among them, to the assembly, and when
all were seated one of the older leaders
of the peasants rose and addressed him.
</p>

<p>
"Olaf, Jarl Eirik will demand stern
payment of this attack on his father,
Hakon, when he hears of it; nevertheless,
we are determined that Jarl Hakon shall
die, for his life has been altogether evil.
You, however, are of the race of our old
Kings, from Harald Fairhair to your
father, Triggve, and in the name of this
assembly I ask you to become King over
us, at least until an assembly of the people
can be held at Thrandheim to elect you in
regular form."
</p>

<p>
This caused the men of Olaf much joy,
and the King accepted the offer of
leadership which they made him.  The same
evening they traveled up the valley to
Rimul, where the Lady Thora lived.  It
was here that the bonders thought Jarl
Hakon was in hiding, but some distance up
the valley, beside the river was found a
cloak, which was recognized as Jarl
Hakon's.
</p>

<p>
"He has perished in the river!" cried
many voices, and this opinion was strengthened
by finding the body of Hakon's horse
farther down, on a sandbank.  But as
everyone was discussing this, an old bonder
came up to Olaf.
</p>

<p>
"Olaf," he remarked, "you know well
how cunning the Jarl is, and how skilled
he is in tricks.  A man of his nature does
not get carried away by a river, however
swift; can you not see that this is but a
trick to make us cease the search and disband?"
</p>

<p>
"That is so," replied Sigurd at once.
"I believe the man is right, King."
</p>

<p>
Others assented to this opinion also, and
the small army pushed on to Rimul.  By
torchlight they made a thorough search
of the homestead of Lady Thora, but
without avail; so King Olaf, standing on a
large stone near the barn, cried out:
</p>

<p>
"Men, we have searched without avail
for Jarl Hakon; at this time we can do no
more.  But know, that with fitting gift and
payment I will reward whoever shall slay
the Jarl and bring me his head."
</p>

<p>
With that they left the homestead, and
proceeded to Ladi, where they remained
for the night.  This was a very large farm
and village, belonging to the Kings of
Norway, and here Olaf took up temporary
quarters.  The men were next morning
landed from the ships, the bonders were
levied, and word was sent throughout the
whole country that King Olaf, son of King
Triggve, had arrived to take the rule from
the hands of Hakon, and that a General
Assembly of the People was to meet at
once at Thrandheim.
</p>

<p>
These things, however, were not all done
in a day.  The very next afternoon, after
reaching Ladi, word was brought to King
Olaf that a man was inquiring for him,
having a large package.  King Olaf and
Sigurd went to the door of the farmhouse,
and saw an ill-favored man wearing the
collar of a thrall, or slave.
</p>

<p>
"What do you want of me?" inquired
the King.
</p>

<p>
For answer the man opened his package
and showed a human head.  Sigurd
could not repress a shudder, and he
turned away; the head was that of Jarl
Hakon of Norway.
</p>

<p>
Olaf called his men at once, and the
thrall told his story.  He was the tooth-thrall
of Hakon, the slave, who, according
to custom, had been given the Jarl when he
cut his first teeth; he had fled with Hakon
from the bonders, and the Lady Thora had
made for them a sure hiding-place in a
cave beneath the pigsty, in the very yard
where Olaf had offered a reward for
Hakon's head.
</p>

<p>
"What led you to betray the Jarl?"
asked Olaf, angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Chiefly for the reward you promised,
King, for we could hear your voice
distinctly.  So I slew him as he slept and
brought his head to you for the promised
reward."
</p>

<p>
"Seize him, men!" cried Olaf, his eyes
blazing with anger as he pointed to the
thrall.  "I will keep the promise which I
made, to give you a fit reward, and it will
keep those who come after us from betraying
their lords!  You dog!  You were the
servant of a wicked man, but he was your
master and a good one to you, and you
were bound to him by oaths the most
sacred.  Your reward shall be a fitting one
indeed; take him out and behead him, men!"
</p>

<p>
When this was done, King Olaf took the
thrall's head, together with that of Hakon,
and sailing out to the island of Nidarholm,
which was used as a place of execution for
evildoers, the two heads were placed on
the gallows.  That night King Olaf gathered
his leaders in the farmhouse at Ladi.
</p>

<p>
"My friends," he said, "Jarl Hakon is
dead, and I doubt if Jarl Eirik will dare
to attack us.  The General Assembly will
be held soon, and I trust that the people
will take me for their king.  It seems to
me that only by the aid of God was the
mighty Hakon overthrown so easily; moreover,
the time is come when idolatry and
heathen worship in Norway must give way
to the Holy Truth.  You have come hither
from Ireland with me, and are you now
willing to give your lives, if need be, to
spread the Word of God?"
</p>

<p>
"Aye!" shouted all, and after a council
it was decided that as soon as Olaf had
been chosen king the first steps should
be taken to stamp out the worship of Thor
and Odin at the great temple in Thrandheim.
Sigurd remembered his adventure
with Vagn in that temple, and he felt a
thrill at thought of planting the Cross in
place of the great golden statue of Thor;
for the words of the King had fired all his
chiefs, and Bishop Sigurd also had spoken
at length.
</p>

<p>
They abode quietly at Ladi for two or
three weeks, Astrid taking up her quarters
in the big farmhouse.  There was nothing
to do save to wait till the bonders met in
General Assembly, and for this reason also
King Olaf waited before tearing down the
great temple to Odin at Ladi.  It would
not be wise to anger the bonders before
being elected; afterwards, when he was
the rightful King, it would be different.
</p>

<p>
Finally word arrived that the delegates
to the Assembly had met from all eight
districts of Norway, so Olaf and his men
traveled up to Thrandheim, at the head of
the Firth.  Olaf was pretty sure of election,
for while he dwelt at Ladi most of the great
men of the country had visited him, and
his handsome presence and kingly mien
had made a very favorable impression;
moreover, he was well known by reputation
as one of the greatest warriors of his time.
</p>

<p>
Arrived at Thrandheim, Olaf, Sigurd,
Astrid and the others of the King's party
were given apartments in the palace of
Jarl Hakon, and two mornings later they
took their way to the Assembly.  Here an
immense crowd was assembled, from the
whole Thrandheim district, and as soon as
the Assembly had been constituted, King
Olaf stood up in sight of all, his red-gold
hair flying in the breeze, the sun streaming
from his golden armor and scarlet cloak.
</p>

<p>
"It is known to all men here assembled
that I have offered myself to be King over
you.  You must expect the sternest
treatment by Jarl Eirik for the attack on his
father, unless you obtain protection; on
the other hand, I have a difficult task
before me in obtaining possession of my
father's realm, after being so long absent."
</p>

<p>
Olaf gave a brief account of his life and
adventures, from his boyhood up to his
discovery of Thorir Klakke's treachery, his
coming to Norway, and the death of
Hakon, and concluded with:
</p>

<p>
"I believe that there is no man in Norway
who by legal right and descent has so
much right to the crown as I.  But I must
be made King by you, the Assembly of the
People, and if you do so I will protect you
and rule you according to the ancient laws
of Norway."
</p>

<p>
The tale of his exile and sufferings
greatly moved the people, who were already
predisposed in his favor.  As he sat down,
half the delegates leaped to their feet.
</p>

<p>
"Skoal!  Olaf Triggveson, skoal!  We
will have you to be our King, and none
other!  Skoal!"
</p>

<p>
A blare of horns mingled with shouts
rent the air, and Sigurd, behind Olaf, set
his great standard flapping in the breeze.
A silence fell over the people as they saw
the Cross, but only for a moment; again
the shout arose, pealing across the town
and the bay and echoing back from hill to
hill behind them:
</p>

<p>
"Skoal to King Olaf!  Skoal!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap22"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXII.
<br /><br />
THE SACRIFICE TO THOR.
</h3>

<p>
Thus was Olaf Triggveson chosen by
the General Assembly to be King
over all Norway, and the rule of the
land was made over to him in accordance
with the old laws, by the officers of the
people.  The bonders swore to be faithful
to him, to support him while he won the
whole kingdom, and to help him to hold it;
Olaf on his part promised to observe the
laws and rights of the people, and to
defend it from all invaders.
</p>

<p>
These ceremonies occupied the better
part of the day, and it was sunset before
Sigurd and Astrid, who had watched the
ceremony, returned to the hall.  They saw
nothing of Olaf for several days, for he
was very busy with the various leaders who
flocked to his banner, and he was raising
men and sending messages to all quarters
of Norway with news of his election.
</p>

<p>
Soon, however, news arrived that the
levies were not needed, for Jarl Eirik and
his brother Svein had fled to Sweden as
soon as the news of their father's death
arrived.  The whole country yielded to
Olaf's rule, glad once more to have a king
of the royal line of rulers, and glad to get
rid of Hakon, who to this day is known as
"Hakon the Bad."
</p>

<p>
King Olaf was eager to preach the gospel
to his people, but Sigurd, his namesake
the Bishop, and the other chiefs saw that
Olaf must first make his hold on the country
firmer, for they foresaw that when the
people found that Olaf was intending to
overturn the old faith, there would be
tumults and revolts.  The King, however,
yielded only in part to them; and refusing
to dwell in Thrandheim, where the great
temple of Thor was situated, began the
building of a second town, Nidaros, a few
miles distant.  So the autumn and early
winter passed.
</p>

<p>
Nevertheless, the news spread that Olaf
was no follower of the old gods, and grave
disturbances took place throughout the
country, for the bonders drew away from
the new King when they found that he was
preaching a new faith to them.  Then one
day came the news that at many of the
larger temples great meetings of the bonders
had taken place, with sacrifices to the
old gods, and there the bonders had solemnly
vowed that they would not allow Olaf
to preach the "White Christ" in Norway.
</p>

<p>
Now all agreed that it was indeed time
to act, unless the kingdom was to be
endangered.  The heart of the country was
the district around Thrandheim, where the
land was most thickly populated, and
where the capital lay; so Olaf realized that
if he once established Christianity here, it
would not be long before the rest of
Norway gave in.
</p>

<p>
With this object he called another
General Assembly at Frosta, near the capital;
but as the message went forth, the bonders
seized the messengers, and substituted a
war-arrow, so that all the chiefs and great
leaders assembled with a huge host, armed
and ready for war.
</p>

<p>
Olaf, who came to the Assembly with
only Sigurd and a score of men, saw that
he was taken in a trap; however, on the
first day of the meeting he conciliated
the Assembly, although when he mentioned
Christ several of the leaders arose and
forbade him to speak on religious subjects
on that day.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd saw that the bonders were in
a bad mood, and that a spark might inflame
them; so that night, as he and King Olaf
sat in their tent, he said:
</p>

<p>
"Olaf, I have a plan which I think will
save us all from further trouble."
</p>

<p>
"Then, by St. Michael, let me have it!"
cried Olaf, "for I am at my wits' end for
want of one!"
</p>

<p>
So Sigurd talked long with the King
that evening.  The next morning, when
the Assembly opened, Olaf arose, and
after a short speech said:
</p>

<p>
"Let us preserve the compact that we
made before, to strengthen and uphold each
other.  To this end I will attend your great
sacrifice two weeks hence at the temple
in Thrandheim, and after this we will take
counsel together concerning the faith that
will be held, and we will agree to hold to
whatever faith we decide upon."
</p>

<p>
At this the bonders gave a great shout
of joy, thinking that King Olaf was
yielding, and the other matters for which the
Assembly had been called passed off
without trouble.
</p>

<p>
When Olaf returned to his new town of
Nidaros a number of men from Iceland
received baptism, shortly after Yuletide.
Many traders and others who were in the
new city of Nidaros, remained through the
winter at Olaf's court, and most of these
were also baptized in the end.
</p>

<p>
For the next two weeks both Sigurd and
the King were busy perfecting Sigurd's
plan.  The chief opponent of Christianity
among the bonders was Ironbeard, a very
powerful chief who was also priest at Moeri,
a town near Thrandheim.  The winter sacrifice
was to be held at the great temple in
Moeri, and if Sigurd's plan went well, all
resistance to Christianity in the district
would be destroyed at one blow.
</p>

<p>
Invitations were sent out to all the chief
men of the bonders, to a feast to be held
at Nidaros three days before the winter
sacrifice.  The greatest chiefs and leaders
of the Thrandheim districts were invited,
and all accepted, save Ironbeard and one or
two others.
</p>

<p>
On the morning bidden, the invited
chiefs streamed into town, on foot, on
horseback, and even on skis.  Many came
over the ice from across the bay, and by
next morning the new city was filled with
men, as each chief brought a party with
him.  Early in the morning Olaf and his
court attended service in the new church,
all the visitors refusing to watch the service.
</p>

<p>
Immediately afterward Sigurd led fifty
men to the harbor.  There they put on
skates, and the young Jarl led them to
Ladi, which was only three miles across
the ice, though more by land.
</p>

<p>
Removing their skates, Sigurd and his
men tramped up from the shore to the
temple which stood on the hill, and raising
his axe, Sigurd struck the door.  In five
minutes it was broken down, while the few
priests who lived near by stood watching
helplessly.
</p>

<p>
Carrying out all the images, Sigurd piled
them in the show ana set fire to them as an
object lesson to the watching priests and
bonders that their gods were powerless.
The temple was then stripped of its valuables
and the building itself burned.  When
this was done, Sigurd and his men made a
cross out of two beams of wood, and this
he planted in the snow over the ruins of
the idols.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-081"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-081.jpg" alt="This cross he planted over the ruins of the idols." />
<br />
<i>This cross he planted over the ruins of the idols.</i>
</p>

<p>
Then, seeing the bonders gathering fast,
he stepped out and addressed them:
</p>

<p>
"Friends, we are here by command of
the King, and you have to-day seen how
powerless your gods are before the true
God.  As you know, your chiefs are now in
Nidaros; when they return they will be
Christian men, no longer heathen."
</p>

<p>
With this Sigurd and his men, laden with
the spoil of the temple, returned to Nidaros.
At the harbor mouth a man met them, for
it was noontime.
</p>

<p>
"Hasten, Jarl!  The Assembly has just
been called!" he cried to Sigurd.  "King
Olaf posted me here to bid you hasten to
the hall."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd hurried on to the palace, bidding
his men wait in the outer rooms till he blew
his horn.  Then he made his way to the
hall, entering it just as the Assembly was
opened by the King.
</p>

<p>
"Chiefs and bonders," said Olaf, looking
sternly around on the two score great
leaders who sat below his high-seat, "I do
not forget that you chose me to be your
King, and gave me this realm of Norway;
but some two weeks ago I called a General
Assembly of the people, and there you and
others refused to hear me preach the gospel
of Christ, and only by promising to attend
the winter sacrifice did I escape injury at
your hands.
</p>

<p>
"Now you and all men know that I have
in many places shamed the false gods, burnt
their images and temples, and in their stead
have erected the Cross of the true God.
But I am conscious of the oath which I
swore to you at that Assembly, and therefore
I propose to sacrifice to your gods the
greatest and highest sacrifice that man may
offer, namely, human life."
</p>

<p>
A little murmur of joy ran around the
hall as Olaf paused.  On great occasions
the Norsemen used to offer as the most
acceptable sacrifice a number of slaves or
criminals, condemned to death.  At the
next words of Olaf, the joyous murmur
ceased.
</p>

<p>
"I do not believe that thralls or malefactors
should be offered to the gods; instead,
they should delight in the blood of
noble men, great chiefs, powerful bonders.
Since you have refused to release me from
my oath, I propose to sacrifice this sort of
men, for we must do our best to appease
the gods, that they may favor us.  Am I
right?"
</p>

<p>
As the King paused again, a doubtful
murmur of assent rose up, and the men, not
quite sure of Olaf's meaning, fixed their
eyes on the King, who stood, handsome and
erect, by his throne.
</p>

<p>
"Therefore," he continued, "I will offer
to your gods the greatest sacrifice that
Norway has ever known.  You must be
eager to receive from them the reward of
your service and past offerings, and for
the purpose of this offering I shall select
you, Orm Lugg, you, Asbiorn of Orness,
you, Stirkar of Gimsa, you, Kar of Gryting,
and I will sacrifice you upon the high altar
of Thor at Thrandeim.  And after this, I
shall select six others, the highest and
worthiest men of this district from among
you, and they shall be sacrificed likewise,
that the gods may send us fruitful seasons
and peace."
</p>

<p><a id="chap23"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXIII.
<br /><br />
HOW THE CHIEFS WERE BAPTIZED.
</h3>

<p>
For a moment the chiefs stared at the
King, incredulous and amazed.  Then,
as they caught the meaning of his
ironic speech, the four men he had named
leaped to their feet, and an angry roar
went up from all.  Olaf's uplifted hand
stilled the murmur.
</p>

<p>
"Wait!  You do not seem so eager for
the companionship of your gods; can it be
that you doubt their power to save you?
If that is really the case, and you wish
to release me from that oath of mine, I
will be right glad to have you all baptized,
and believe in the mighty, gentle and kind
God whom I and my men serve."
</p>

<p>
At these words Sigurd blew his horn,
and the doors in the side of the hall flew
open.  His men brought in the spoils of the
Ladi temple and laid them at Olaf's feet,
while other armed men filed silently into
the room.
</p>

<p>
"Here," exclaimed Olaf, pointing to the
temple utensils and trappings, "you see
how powerless your gods are to save their
belongings!  Now think it over, while my
men watch the doors; I will return in a few
minutes."
</p>

<p>
With these words he left the hall,
followed by Sigurd.  Outside the door he
gripped the boy's arm joyfully, and was
about to speak when an indignant voice
broke on their ears:
</p>

<p>
"What is this tale I hear, King Olaf?"
</p>

<p>
Looking up they saw before them the
old English Bishop, Sigurd, clad in his
vestments.  His face was stern and cold
as Olaf bowed to him.
</p>

<p>
"Is this tale true?  That you hold the
Thrandheim chiefs in the great hall, offering
them their choice of baptism or death?
Answer me!"
</p>

<p>
Astounded, the King gazed at the Bishop,
then after a moment his eyes fell.
</p>

<p>
"Why, Bishop, it is true, certainly!
What mean you?"
</p>

<p>
The old man's eyes flashed.  "Think
you that this is the way to spread the gospel
of Christ?  Is baptism a thing to be forced
on men, or a thing which they must choose
willingly?  Better lose this kingdom of
yours and flee back over the ocean again
than to do this thing, Olaf Triggveson!"
</p>

<p>
At this the boy spoke out.  "Bishop, it
it my fault, for I suggested the plan; but
why is it so bad?  Did not the chiefs
entrap Olaf a week or two ago?"
</p>

<p>
Bishop Sigurd turned on him.  "What
of that?  Do as you will with the bodies
of these men, Olaf, but force not their
souls!  Let them come to Christ willingly."  His
voice softened.  "I know that you both
are only overzealous; but believe me, King
and Jarl, this is not Christianity.  Christ
said, 'Come unto me'; think you he would
have men driven to him with whips and
swords, who died to save men?"
</p>

<p>
Olaf bent his head, and Sigurd dropped
on his knees.  "Pardon, Bishop!  I had
not thought of it that way; I see how
wrong it was now!"
</p>

<p>
The Bishop put his hand on Sigurd's
head.  "And you, Olaf?  Do you not see
that I am right?  Must you be led by this boy?"
</p>

<p>
Olaf, fixing his keen eyes on the old man,
nodded slowly.  "I see, Bishop, and I will
obey your unspoken thought."
</p>

<p>
He turned slowly, and Sigurd followed
him to the door of the great hall.  As they
entered there was a hush, and Olaf curtly
bade his men leave the building, waiting in
silence as they filed out.
</p>

<p>
Then, ascending the high-seat, he said
bitterly:
</p>

<p>
"Chiefs, I came among you preaching
the Word of God, the gospel of peace and
salvation; but my own acts have been as
those of a pagan and worse.  Small wonder
that you refused to accept my faith!  Too
late I see that I have done ill by you; now
I stand ready to repair my faults, and to
act as a true Christian.  Go in peace; those
of you who wish to accept Christianity will
be welcomed.  If it is your wish that a
heathen King rule over you, I will return
whence I came, and will bring no fire and
sword into the land."
</p>

<p>
The chiefs gazed in amazement at the
King, and Orm Lugg, one of the greatest
spoke out:
</p>

<p>
"Is this truth, King?  Are we free to go
to our homes?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes," said Olaf, a flush mounting to his
brow.  "I have proved myself a poor
Christian, friends, but forgive me for this
time; go, and whatever is your will I shall
abide by it."
</p>

<p>
One by one, silent, incredulous, the chiefs
left the hall, and Sigurd alone remained
with the King.  Then the boy, grasping
Olaf's hand, cried with tears in his eyes:
</p>

<p>
"Olaf, we have been wrong, but how
you must suffer!  Will you really go back
to Ireland if the chiefs refuse to accept
the gospel?"
</p>

<p>
"Yes, my friend," and Olaf's tone was
very low and soft.  "The good Bishop
yonder showed me more in that minute than I
can tell you.  I have been proud, Sigurd,
and my pride is shattered; the Hammer
of Thor is not like Christ's Cross.  I
thought to use the Cross like a weapon, like
Thor uses his Hammer; but the Cross is a
symbol, not of pride and might, but of
gentleness, of pity, of humility.  Yes, my&mdash;"
</p>

<p>
Suddenly the doors opened, and in came
the chiefs, to the King's amazement.  Their
faces were very changed now; the fierceness,
the resistance, seemed to have given
way to some new emotion.
</p>

<p>
"King Olaf," said Orm, the spokesman,
"we found it as you said; the palace is
unguarded, the streets are clear.  Oh, King,
I have a hard thing to say, but mayhap
you will understand!  Listen.
</p>

<p>
"We bonders have in truth resisted your
faith because, as you said just now, you
preached one thing to us, and you acted
another thing.  We have resisted, not
because we love the old gods, but because we
could not see wherein the White Christ was
better."
</p>

<p>
Orm paused, fixing his eyes on the
King's.  "But to-day, King Olaf, you have
shown us a new thing.  We have not
known you long, yet we have found in you
a strong man, a proud man, a man used to
ruling the wills of others, and for this we
have rejoiced in a worthy King.  To-day,
Olaf, we have found that there was one
thing stronger than these, a thing able to
overcome all your strength, pride&mdash;even
your will; and because this is so, we freely
accept from your hand the Cross of Christ."
</p>

<p>
For a moment Olaf gazed at the men
around him, unable to speak.  Then, the
tears flowing down his cheeks, he pressed
their hands, one by one, and said:
</p>

<p>
"My friends, this is a victory where I
had found a defeat.  I cannot tell you what
it means to me, but I think that none of
us will forget this day.  Jarl Sigurd and I
have to-day learned a lesson from you and
from ourselves; pray God we may never
have to learn it over again!"
</p>

<p>
Then Sigurd summoned the Bishop, telling
him what had happened on the way,
and without delay the chiefs were baptized
in Olaf's new church, together with their
men.  That night Olaf and Sigurd sat in
Astrid's chamber, talking over the events
of the day until late.
</p>

<p>
King Olaf had given Astrid part of Jarl
Hakon's forfeited estates, to compensate
her for those she possessed in Vendland, so
that she might be able to live as became
her dignity; further, he constituted himself
her ward, although with the laughing
declaration that he would run the risk of
forcing her to marry against her will.  He had
also promised to give Sigurd an earldom,
as soon as he had put the country into some
kind of order.
</p>

<p>
"What are now your plans, my lord?"
asked the girl, that same night.  Olaf shook
his head.
</p>

<p>
"Truly, Astrid, I know not.  Practically
all of the greater chiefs from the Thrandheim
districts were baptized to-day, and I
think that the bond established between us
will never be broken.  Ironbeard alone
holds out; I am strongly minded to visit
him at once, during the winter sacrifice,
and try to win him over.  To-morrow,
Sigurd, we will go to Thrandheim and
demolish the great temple there."
</p>

<p>
For a minute Sigurd looked at Olaf, then
the latter smiled.  "No, Sigurd, I have
learned my lesson.  There will be no
bloodshed, either there or at the winter
sacrifice, if I can help it.  But the greatest
chiefs have been baptized; now it is essential
that Ironbeard be either forced to accept
my rule or leave the country."
</p>

<p>
So, without the least opposition, Olaf and
Sigurd burned the old temple of the war-god
the very next day.  Many of the chiefs so
recently baptized showed their sincerity by
joining Olaf or sending men to his aid;
and the idols were taken out before all the
people, and burned.  Sigurd longed for Vagn
to be there, as he remembered their adventure
with Jarl Hakon; but his cousin was
far away to the south.
</p>

<p>
The work was finished by midday, and
the party returned to Nidaros.  The sudden
conversion of their greatest chiefs seemed
to have demoralized the bonders, for no
longer were threats heard against Olaf, but
instead, many of them came to Nidaros and
were baptized by the good Bishop.
</p>

<p>
The day after the destruction of the
Thrandheim temple, Olaf prepared to go
to Moeri, where the winter sacrifice was
held.  He took all his men, sailing up
Thrandheim Firth with his largest ships,
and came to Moeri the day of the sacrifice.
</p>

<p>
The King sent Sigurd ashore, demanding
that the people first hold an Assembly.
Fairhair found a great multitude assembled
from all the countryside, with Ironbeard
and his men all present.  They at once
agreed to Olaf's demand, so the King
landed with his men, and the Assembly was
constituted on the plain before the temple.
</p>

<p>
When the noise and talking of the opening
had subsided, Olaf arose in his seat and
told the bonders what had taken place in
his hall at Nidaros, told them how he had
found his mistake, and would no longer try
to force a religion on them that they did
not want.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd could see a change sweep over
the faces of the bonders before him, and
they glanced at each other and began
whispering.  At this, however, Ironbeard
leaped to his feet&mdash;an immense man, wearing
the robes of a priest of Thor, and with
an iron-gray beard that swept over his chest.
He lifted his hand and began to speak,
slowly and with great dignity.

CHAPTER XXIV.
<br /><br />
OLAF'S ATONEMENT.
</h3>

<p>
"King Olaf," rang out the priest's
deep voice, "we are unwilling
that you should violate our religion.
The wish of us all is that you
should offer sacrifice as other kings before
you have done, and even as Jarl Hakon did.
When King Hakon, foster son of King
Athelstan of England, wished to proclaim
the White Christ, he found the bonders too
strong for him, and he yielded to the old
faith.  The only proper plan for you is to
do likewise, for our minds have not changed
since that Assembly wherein you promised
to visit this temple at this time."
</p>

<p>
Ironbeard sat down, and his speech was
loudly applauded by the bonders who sat
around, and by the great crowd without.
Olaf flushed at the chief's proud demands,
but controlling his temper, he rose.
</p>

<p>
"My friends, I promised to visit your
temple, and I shall do so now, before the
sacrifices.  The Assembly is closed."
</p>

<p>
With this he motioned to Sigurd, and,
followed by his men, who had laid aside
their arms, he walked to the door of the
temple.  Olaf held in his hand a
gold-mounted staff of heavy wood, and as they
entered he said to Sigurd:
</p>

<p>
"Jarl, do just as I do, and act quickly."
</p>

<p>
Inside they saw many images around the
temple, and occupying the place of honor
was a large idol, heavily adorned with gold
and silver.  The temple was now full of
Olaf's men, while Ironbeard and the bonders
stood in the doorway, watching him.
</p>

<p>
Without another word the King walked
up to the large idol, and raising his heavy
staff, struck it.  The idol toppled over, fell
to the stone floor, and broke in two parts.
At the same instant Sigurd and his men
rushed at the other images and swept them
from their pedestals.
</p>

<p>
A loud cry of horror arose from the
bonders, and Ironbeard, seizing a spear,
poised it, in the act of hurling it at the
King.  As he did so, one of Olaf's men,
who was outside, pierced him with an
arrow, and he fell at the temple threshold.
</p>

<p>
The bonders drew back, in terror, and
the King turned angrily.
</p>

<p>
"Who fired that arrow?" he shouted.  The
man who had done so stepped to the door.
</p>

<p>
"It was I, King Olaf, and I did it to save
your life.  Ironbeard had poised a spear at
you&mdash;see, it is even now in his hand!"
</p>

<p>
Olaf looked at the fallen leader, and saw
that the man spoke truly.  "Order the
Assembly called," he said to Sigurd.  "Bid
them have no fear."
</p>

<p>
When the people had taken their places
again, Olaf came out of the temple and
addressed them from the steps:
</p>

<p>
"Friends and bonders, I did not come
here to shed blood, and I am bitterly
grieved that Ironbeard drew his fate on
himself.  As I told you a little time ago,
I will compel no man to leave his faith; I
have discovered the wickedness of that
course.  But a few days ago your other chiefs,
some of whom stand at my side, accepted
from my hands the Cross of Christ, and
now I offer it to you also.
</p>

<p>
"You have seen how your gods have
fallen and broken.  Where is their power,
think you?  The true God has protected
me, has brought me to this kingdom and
given it into my hand without a struggle,
and whether you will it or not, his faith
will prevail in Norway before many more
years have passed."
</p>

<p>
The King paused, and one of the bonders
arose to reply.
</p>

<p>
"Oh, King, your words to-day have
fallen pleasantly on our ears, and we easily
perceive that you have truth and justice
in your heart.  We see, too, that the gods
are dead, and that they have no power
before the Cross of the White Christ.  But,
King Olaf, the slaying of Ironbeard was an
evil deed, whether you intended it or not,
and before we say more on this subject we
would like to know whether you will punish
his murderer."
</p>

<p>
The bonder sat down amid a faint murmur
of applause, and the Assembly fixed
their eyes on Olaf.  For a moment the King
sat in silence, and it was evident that he
was struggling with himself; then his face
cleared.
</p>

<p>
"My people, I will not punish the man,
for he saved my life.  Wait!  I am not
through.  Are there any relatives of
Ironbeard present?"
</p>

<p>
Two men stood up.  "We are distant
relatives of his, oh, King, but he has left
no others to mourn him save a single
daughter."
</p>

<p>
King Olaf took off his helm.  "My people,
this is a lawful Assembly, able to give
judgment and to punish criminals, with
power to inflict penalty for offenses.  I
appoint you two bonders judges, and I take
upon my own head the blood of Ironbeard.
Whatever you shall think right, I will agree
to, in compensation for his death.  Whether
you demand my life, or my exile, or a scat
in money, these will I give, and you shall
fear no punishment from my men."
</p>

<p>
At these words a silence fell on the
host, and Sigurd gazed at Olaf in love and
admiration.  Truly, old Bishop Sigurd had
not spoken in vain!  A murmur of appreciation
of Olaf's generous offer passed from
mouth to mouth, and presently the two
relatives of Ironbeard, after conferring
together, stood up.
</p>

<p>
"King Olaf, by these words of yours you
have indeed shamed us, who came to this
Assembly with arms, and with war in our
hearts.  It is a new departure in Norway,
that her Kings should offer themselves
under the laws like common men; and yet
it seems not unfair to us that you should
do so.  The laws declare that for the
shedding of blood the relatives of the dead man
may claim the life of the slayer, or they
may claim a scat in lands or goods.  Now,
King Olaf, Ironbeard has left no family
save a daughter, who has no lack of wealth
and is of good family.  We, therefore, her
relatives, lay this judgment upon you: that
you make her your lawful wife and bestow
upon her lands befitting her position
as Queen."
</p>

<p>
The King's men uttered a growl of protest,
even Sigurd looking somewhat blank,
for the King had thought of marrying one
of the daughters of the Swedish King, to
make an alliance between the two nations.
Olaf, however, checked the murmur with
a gesture, and replied to the bonders:
</p>

<p>
"My friends, this is a lawful judgment,
and I accept it with good will.  I will
expect you two men to look to it that the maid
is sent to Nidaros before Eastertide, at
which time I shall marry her and make her
the Queen of this land.  It is the least I can
do, methinks, after my men have killed her
father and left her alone in the world.
Should this plan not meet with her consent,
I will expect you to appoint other penalty,
which I will fulfill most faithfully, and this
I swear on the Cross."
</p>

<p>
Olaf sat down amid a shout of approval
and joy from the bonders, and a dozen
men rose at once to speak.  Making one
of their number spokesman, he addressed
the King.
</p>

<p>
"My lord, when I left home it was my
firm intention to resist your faith to the last
drop of my blood; but now I am proud to
take baptism from your hands, and to
swear anew my allegiance to you."
</p>

<p>
Olaf started up in surprise, and one by
one the other bonders rose and declared
their intention to be baptized.  Then Olaf
sent for Bishop Sigurd, whom he had left
at the ships, fearing that Ironbeard might
attack him, and turned to the bonders.
</p>

<p>
"My people, nothing that you could do
would give me more pleasure than this
thing.  It is the dearest wish of my heart
that this land of Norway should become
Christian, and once you and the other
leaders of Thrandheim and the districts around
have received baptism, we will meet with
little opposition from the rest of the land.
In pledge of your earnestness I ask that
you complete the destruction of this your
temple to the old gods, and on its site I
will erect at my own expense a church to
the true God."
</p>

<p>
Shouting and clashing their arms, the
bonders sprang up without an instant's
hesitation.  They ran to the temple, carried
out the broken images, and piled them in
the snow, while others stripped the temple
of its furnishings and set fire to it.  As the
pile of idols broke into flame, old Bishop
Sigurd arrived from the ships.
</p>

<p>
He had been told the whole story on the
way up the hill, and he gripped Olaf's hand
silently but heartily as the King met him.
At once the work of baptism was begun,
Sigurd and the rest of the King's men taking
part in the service, and standing as
godfathers to the new converts.
</p>

<p>
When this was finished the afternoon
was nearly spent, and after arranging with
the leaders of the people for the building
of a church, for the burial of Ironbeard,
and for the sending of his daughter
Gudrun to Nidaros at Easter, Olaf's men
embarked, and the King sailed back down the
Firth to Nidaros.
</p>

<p>
A few days before this the Firth had
opened, for although it was still winter, the
weather had warmed somewhat, and a
channel had been made from above Moeri to
the open sea.  When the fleet came to the
harbor that night, they found the town
alight with torches, and lying in the harbor
were several newly arrived ships, or rather
cutters, for they were small.
</p>

<p>
"I wonder what this means?" said the
King, as they drew into the anchorage.  "I
had no tidings of visitors, when we left the
city yesterday, and it is strange that the
town is all alight!"
</p>

<p>
So before the ships had come to anchor,
Olaf and Sigurd leaped into a small boat
and were rowed ashore.  Their ships had
been seen entering, for great fires were lit
on either side of the harbor, making everything
plain to the sight, and a crowd of men
met them as they landed.
</p>

<p>
"What is all this excitement about?"
demanded the King, looking around in wonder.
</p>

<p>
A confused talking answered him.
"Here, one at a time!" shouted Olaf, and
one of the men stepped to his side.
</p>

<p>
"We have been driven from home, my
lord King, and we come from the north.
There two chiefs, Raud the Strong and
Thori Hart, have revolted against the
White Christ, have gathered a fleet, and are
sailing against you.  They are preparing to
restore the temples of Thor and Odin and
to burn the churches you have built; we,
who are Christians, have barely escaped
with our lives, fleeing in our small boats.
The heathen will enter the Firth in a few
days, unless you meet them first!"
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap25"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXV.
<br /><br />
THE WRESTLING MATCH.
</h3>

<p>
Olaf at once went to the great hall,
and there the fugitives came before
him and told their story.  The two
Northern chieftains had taken advantage of
the unexampled spell of warm weather to
raise a fleet and sail down the coast,
thinking to come upon the King just as he had
come upon Jarl Hakon.
</p>

<p>
Olaf quickly consulted with Sigurd, the
Bishop, and his other leaders, and their
opinion was that not a minute was to be
lost.  If the King embarked that night
and sailed out of the Firth, he would
reach the entrance by morning, and could
wait for the heathen fleet there.
</p>

<p>
The King agreed to this plan, and at
once sent word to his men to return on
board the ships.  The Thrandheim chiefs
now proved their loyalty by refusing to
return to their homes.
</p>

<p>
"No, King," said they, "you have dealt
with us fairly and honorably, and we are
sensible of it.  We and our men will be of
use if it comes to a battle, and the enemy
may lose heart when they see us, for
evidently they count on our forces joining
them.  So set up our standards on your
ships, and we will gladly accompany you."
</p>

<p>
At this decision the King was overjoyed,
for with these men were several hundred
warriors in all, who had gathered at the
Moeri Assembly.  So a few hours later
Olaf and Sigurd left Nidaros again, with a
dozen ships, while more would follow as
soon as they had been taken off their
winter dry-docks.
</p>

<p>
The ships rowed down the Firth all
night, while Olaf and Sigurd rested.  The
day had been a terribly hard one on both,
and they were glad to get what sleep they
could before meeting the advancing foes.
</p>

<p>
The week of warm weather seemed a
wonderful thing to all the men, and not a
few ascribed it to the favor of heaven
upon Olaf.  It was only barely past
Yuletide, and although no one expected the
warm weather to last, few of the oldest
men could remember a winter when
Thrandheim Firth had remained open, or
had opened before April.
</p>

<p>
By morning they were outside the cape
of Agdaness, where the traitor Thorkel had
been executed.  The King ordered the ships
to be hove to here, in order to wait for the
six other ships which were following from
Nidaros.  All day long they waited, seeing
nothing of the rebels.  Two or three small
ships, bearing more fugitives, came down
the coast, and gave Olaf the news that
Raud and Thori were only fifteen miles to
the north, that they had landed at Theksdale,
and were summoning men to join
them from all the country.
</p>

<p>
That afternoon the reinforcements came
up from Nidaros, and the King held a
council on his ship the "Crane."
</p>

<p>
"First," he said, "I am resolved that if
it can possibly be avoided there shall be no
bloodshed in this matter.  Now let me have
your council on how we shall act to gain
these rebels over, if that can be done."
</p>

<p>
Sigurd spoke first.  "It may be that you
did not note it, King Olaf, but old Biorn,
my forecastle man, is strongly of the opinion
that to-night a heavy frost will set in.
This warm weather has not been natural at
all; even this afternoon the sun has been
growing somewhat colder.
</p>

<p>
"Now, if a frost returns to-night, it will
be no light one, and Biorn says that the
Firth will again be closed to us.  In this
case, it seems to me that any ships lying
along the shore would be frozen fast,
especially if they were in such a narrow bay as
that at Theksdale.  I think that Raud and
Thori will give little heed to their ships,
drawing them on shore carelessly, or
perhaps anchoring them near by; and if this
is the case, and we come upon them suddenly,
they will probably be so disheartened
at the loss of their ships, and at being left
so far from home without means of retreat,
that they will give in."
</p>

<p>
A cry of delight broke from the King and
the others.  "That is the very solution of
it!" exclaimed Olaf.  "But&mdash;it depends on
whether or not a frost sets in.  In any case
we will leave the land, so as not to be
frozen in ourselves."
</p>

<p>
The chiefs separated to their respective
vessels, and all sailed out two or three miles
to sea, where they lay tossing quietly.  At
sunset Bishop Sigurd, who was aboard the
"Crane," conducted a solemn service,
during which he offered a solemn prayer that
God would favor their enterprise; as the
men on all the ships joined in the responses,
it seemed to Sigurd Fairhair that never had
he witnessed a more impressive sight than
this.  Eighteen ships, all crowded with
men, a large portion of whom had only a
few days before been worshipers of idols,
lay grouped together in the sunset glow,
while from them arose a devout and
heart-felt prayer to the White Christ.
</p>

<p>
No sooner had the sun set and darkness
fallen upon the ocean, than the night turned
bitterly cold.  Many of the men, not
expecting this, had left off their furs and
cloaks, so that the others divided theirs
among all.  In some of the ships were bales
of merchandise, and at the King's order
these were opened by torchlight and all the
men without cloaks were furnished with them.
</p>

<p>
By midnight it was evident that the
intense cold would close the Firth, and as
Sigurd had foreseen, would also hold the
enemy helpless.  Amid a shout of rejoicing
from all the men, the prows were turned
north, and the ships rowed swiftly toward
Theksdale, for there was not a breath of
wind, and every minute the cold seemed to
increase.
</p>

<p>
With sunrise the pilots announced that
they were not far from their goal, and an
hour later they rounded the islands outside
Theksdale Bay.  There, however, they were
stopped by a ragged line of ice, nearly a
foot thick, which had formed during the
night.
</p>

<p>
In all haste, for as yet they had not come
around the headland into the bay itself, the
crews disembarked without mishap, and
gained the shore, leaving men on board the
ships to keep them safe.  They made their
way, under guidance of men who knew the
coast, across the headland; and there before
them lay the army of revolt, their fleet
fast-bound in fetters of ice along the shore!
</p>

<p>
"Come," exclaimed Olaf to his nearest
leaders, "we must lose no time, for, see,
they are cutting the ships out of the ice!"
</p>

<p>
So, leading the way, he dashed over the
rocks of the shore, and as the first shouts of
alarm went up from the heathen army, Olaf
and part of his men stood between them and
their ships, while over the brow of the hill
poured the remainder of his forces.
</p>

<p class="capcenter">
<a id="img-093"></a>
<img class="imgcenter" src="images/img-093.jpg" alt="Olaf and his men stood between them and their ships." />
<br />
<i>Olaf and his men stood between them and their ships.</i>
</p>

<p>
The rebel camp seethed and boiled with
men, but seeing that Olaf made no move to
attack them, their haste quieted somewhat,
and in a few minutes two well-appareled
chiefs left the tents and with a dozen men
approached the King.
</p>

<p>
"Have we safe conduct, King Olaf?"
shouted one.
</p>

<p>
"Have no fear," replied Olaf, "come in peace."
</p>

<p>
As they approached, men who knew them
whispered to the King that these were Raud
the Strong and Thori Hart.  Both were of
lofty stature and magnificently built, with
strong, vigorous features.  They stopped
a dozen paces from the King.
</p>

<p>
"From your appearance you are Olaf
Triggveson," said one.  "I am Raud the
Strong, and this is Thori Hart.  Have you
come in peace or in war, oh, King?"
</p>

<p>
A smile ran around Olaf's men, and he
himself laughed outright.
</p>

<p>
"That is a strange question, Raud, when
you have attacked my people and declared
your intention of driving me from the
land!"
</p>

<p>
The other two flushed, and Raud's face
darkened.  "You have caught me," he cried
angrily, "by fault of the Ice King, where
my men can ill defend themselves, and I see
that you have many more warriors than I
looked for; yet you will not find me the last
to cross swords with you, Olaf!"
</p>

<p>
"Hold, Raud," answered Olaf, "I mean
not to attack you.  Now see, I have your
ships yonder, I have a much larger force
than you, and yet if you will not yield
willingly to me you shall depart in peace to
your homes, on condition simply that you
abandon the revolt against my rule."
</p>

<p>
"Why," cried Thori Hart in wonder,
"we thought that you made choice of the
Cross or the sword to your subjects!  Mean
you that we will not be forced to baptism?"
</p>

<p>
Olaf smiled sadly.  "You will not, Thori.
All the chiefs in the Thrandheim districts
have been baptized, but willingly, as those
with me here can testify.  Now, what is
your decision?"
</p>

<p>
The two whispered together for a minute,
until finally Raud spoke up, advancing
toward the King.
</p>

<p>
"You have fairly overcome us, King
Olaf, and we thank you for our lives.  Still,
I am not ready to accept your faith.  I am
a great priest of Thor in the north, and
you seem to be the champion of the White
Christ, so I propose that you and I pray to
our gods, and after that we indulge in a
wrestling match.  The winner, he who first
throws the other to earth, shall bestow his
faith on all the men of the loser.  This
Thori and I agree to, if you will also."
</p>

<p>
Olaf, without hesitation, replied, "I will
accept the trial, here and now, trusting to
the mercy of Almighty God that he will
nerve my arm against your power and that
of your false gods!
</p>

<p>
"But one condition I would make, Raud;
that is, that whoever loses this contest shall
forfeit his life with it."
</p>

<p>
The viking joyfully agreed, and then
returned to his camp.  The men of King Olaf
had all arrived, and as word of the
challenge passed through the army, more than
one covert smile was seen, for already men
said that Olaf was the strongest man in all
the land.
</p>

<p>
It was so bitterly cold that a great fire
was built, and on one side of the space,
scraped clear of snow, marked out for the
match, grouped Olaf's men; on the other
side the heathen followers of Raud stood,
full of confidence in their leader, for he was
very strong, whence his name, and skilled
in wrestling.
</p>

<p>
Stepping into the open space between the
two armies, Olaf and Raud threw off their
helmets and armor, and took hold of each
other.
</p>

<p><br /><br /><br /></p>

<p><a id="chap26"></a></p>

<h3>
CHAPTER XXVI.
<br /><br />
THE CROSS AND THE HAMMER.
</h3>

<p>
Sigurd's heart sank as he saw the
mighty muscles and powerful limbs of
the pagan; but he glanced at Olaf, and
while the latter's muscles were not so big,
he knew that there was terrible strength in
them.
</p>

<p>
At first the opponents tried out each other
carefully; then, gradually warming up,
Raud made terrific attempts to throw Olaf,
but the latter resisted every endeavor,
seemingly without effort.  Now was seen the
difference in the two men's lives, for while
Raud speedily lost his wind, became flushed
and tired, King Olaf looked as fresh as
when he began the conflict, owing to his
temperate life.
</p>

<p>
As the viking weakened, Olaf suddenly
seized him by the thigh in an unguarded
moment, and with a movement of his hands
flung the man over his head.  Amid a shout
from his men, and a groan of dismay from
those of Raud, the latter struck the ground,
Olaf leaping to his side.
</p>

<p>
As the fallen man struggled up, the King
seized his hand and aided him.  "You
have won fairly, Olaf," gasped Raud,
looking with wondering eyes on his antagonist,
"and my life is yours."
</p>

<p>
"Nay," said the King, kindly, handing
the viking his garments, "I seek no man's
blood, Raud.  All I ask is that you serve
me faithfully, and you shall have the same
lands that you held from Hakon."
</p>

<p>
Messengers were at once despatched
overland to Nidaros, to tell of the outcome
of the conflict; then, after Raud, Thori and
his men had been baptized, for they
accepted the condition willingly, Olaf
embarked his men again and they returned
south.
</p>

<p>
The Firth was of course closed again, so
the ships were drawn ashore for the winter,
and the chiefs of the bonders left the King
for their homes, while he pushed on across
the snow-clad hills with his own men.  At
Ladi they crossed the ice to Nidaros, and
were received with much joy.
</p>

<p>
At Eastertide the marriage of King Olaf
and Gudrun, the daughter of Ironbeard,
was solemnized by Bishop Sigurd; and at
the same time Sigurd Fairhair and Astrid
were married.  The wedding was a surprise
to no one, as the whole court knew the story
of their adventures, and had long since
agreed that sooner or later the two would
be wedded.
</p>

<p>
Easter of this year came late in April,
and the Firth had been open for some time.
As the procession left the church and
wended through the streets of Nidaros to
the great hall, a wonderful ship was seen
entering the harbor.  The prow ended in
a dragon's head, the stern in the coils and
tail of a dragon; both prow and stern were
gilded, shining bravely in the morning sun.
The hoisted sail represented a dragon's
wings, and the glistening oar blades the
beast's legs.
</p>

<p>
A cry of amazement went up from all,
but the King turned, with a smile at Sigurd.
</p>

<p>
"This ship I have had built in secret, and
it is my wedding gift to my faithful Jarl,
Sigurd Fairhair.  It is not fitting that a
Jarl of mine should be landless, so I also
bestow on him the earldom of the Agdirs,
and command that he take his wedding
journey thither in this his new ship!"
</p>

<p>
* * * * * *
</p>

<p>
Four years later King Olaf Triggveson,
with a few of his ships, was entrapped by
the treacherous Jarl Sigvald among the
islands of Svold Sound, while the main
part of his fleet was out at sea.
</p>

<p>
Here had gathered his enemies&mdash;the
King of Sweden, King Svein, of Denmark,
who had turned against Olaf, and the
heathen men of Norway, who had chosen
rather to leave the land than to accept the
Cross.  One by one the King's ships were
taken, although he made such a defense as
Norway had never seen, and at one time it
seemed as though he would win, even
against such odds.  Then Jarl Eirik, the
son of Jarl Hakon, tore the dragon-prows
from his ships, and rowed to the attack
under the sign of the Cross.
</p>

<p>
As the last of King Olaf's men fell on
his forecastle, the King threw aside his
shield and sprang overboard.  He was
famous as a swimmer through all the lands
of the north, and now he dived deeply,
swimming under the keels of his enemies'
ships, so that it seemed to them that he
had drowned.
</p>

<p>
Coming up outside the ring of vessels,
the King swam swiftly to a fishing boat that
lay in by the islands, and was pulled
aboard by Sigurd and his wife Astrid, who
had come too late to warn Olaf of the plot
to betray him.  That night, with his
wounds bound, the King sat in the stern of
the boat, which sailed swiftly south.
</p>

<p>
Sigurd urged Olaf to go north, offering
to take him to his fleet, which could return
and meet the invaders, but the King refused.
</p>

<p>
"No, my friends, I cannot do this.  Toward
the end of the fight Jarl Eirik hoisted
the Cross, and I believe he made a vow
that he and his men would renounce the
old gods forever if he conquered me.
Therefore, it seems to me that by the will
of God, Norway has become Christian at
last, and also I am not without fear that
God has been displeased with my rule."
</p>

<p>
"Then shall we go to England with you?
You have many great friends there, and
King Ethelred, who is almost driven from
his kingdom by the Danes, would gladly
give you a share of his realm," said Astrid.
Again the King shook his head.
</p>

<p>
"No," he replied, "let me be as dead
to the realm of Norway, for I will never
trouble it again.  I will go to Rome, and
after that to Jerusalem.  There the Crusaders
rule the Holy Land, and I will join
them and devote the rest of my life to
serving against the Moslem.  I believe that
God used me as an instrument for giving
his Word to Norway, and now that this is
accomplished, it were best to give peace to
this troubled realm."
</p>

<p>
Seeing that it was useless to urge Olaf
further, Sigurd sadly gave up, and two
days later they arrived in his earldom of
Agdir.  Here the King remained for two
weeks, then, fearing that his presence
would bring trouble on his old friends,
decided that he would at once start on his
pilgrimage.
</p>

<p>
"Make your peace with the conquerors,
Sigurd," he said.  "They will be glad to
retain you in your possessions here."
</p>

<p>
With this he selected a score of men and
a small ship of Sigurd's, and departed
from Norway forever.  As he and Sigurd
and Astrid stood together on the forecastle,
just as the anchor was raised, the
King said sadly:
</p>

<p>
"My friends, it is for the best, believe
me, and now peace will come to the land.
The faith of Christ has been established,
and although men may return at times to
the old gods, I think that it will not be for
long.  Now take this sword of mine, even
as you took one long ago in Ireland, and
wear it in memory of me; I will never use
a weapon again, save in defense of the
Holy Land."
</p>

<p>
Embracing the King with tears, Sigurd
and Astrid left the ship; and an hour later
it was a white speck far on the horizon.
</p>

<p>
"Come, Astrid," said Sigurd, "we will
never see Olaf again; yet he will always
be remembered as the first King of
Norway to overthrow the Hammer of Thor,
and to plant in its stead the Cross of
Christ!"
</p>

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
